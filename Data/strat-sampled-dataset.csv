1,Reconstructing Subject-Specific Effect Maps,"  Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease
related alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can
be made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the
subject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual
measurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely
used, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,
is rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of
dispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction
method, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive
modeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically
aims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite
sample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type
algorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic
manner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed
as a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are
estimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental
evaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on
synthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy
compared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the
ADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between
subject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score
and Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on
the longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when
RSM is used.

2,Rotation Invariance Neural Network,"  Rotation invariance and translation invariance have great values in image
recognition tasks. In this paper, we bring a new architecture in convolutional
neural network (CNN) named cyclic convolutional layer to achieve rotation
invariance in 2-D symbol recognition. We can also get the position and
orientation of the 2-D symbol by the network to achieve detection purpose for
multiple non-overlap target. Last but not least, this architecture can achieve
one-shot learning in some cases using those invariance.

3,Spherical polyharmonics and Poisson kernels for polyharmonic functions,"  We introduce and develop the notion of spherical polyharmonics, which are a
natural generalisation of spherical harmonics. In particular we study the
theory of zonal polyharmonics, which allows us, analogously to zonal harmonics,
to construct Poisson kernels for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated
balls. We find the representation of Poisson kernels and zonal polyharmonics in
terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials. We show the connection between the
classical Poisson kernel for harmonic functions on the ball, Poisson kernels
for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated balls, and the Cauchy-Hua
kernel for holomorphic functions on the Lie ball.

4,A finite element approximation for the stochastic Maxwell--Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert system,"  The stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert (LLG) equation coupled with the
Maxwell equations (the so called stochastic MLLG system) describes the creation
of domain walls and vortices (fundamental objects for the novel nanostructured
magnetic memories). We first reformulate the stochastic LLG equation into an
equation with time-differentiable solutions. We then propose a convergent
$\theta$-linear scheme to approximate the solutions of the reformulated system.
As a consequence, we prove convergence of the approximate solutions, with no or
minor conditions on time and space steps (depending on the value of $\theta$).
Hence, we prove the existence of weak martingale solutions of the stochastic
MLLG system. Numerical results are presented to show applicability of the
method.

5,Mean Reverting Portfolios via Penalized OU-Likelihood Estimation,"  We study an optimization-based approach to con- struct a mean-reverting
portfolio of assets. Our objectives are threefold: (1) design a portfolio that
is well-represented by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with parameters estimated
by maximum likelihood, (2) select portfolios with desirable characteristics of
high mean reversion and low variance, and (3) select a parsimonious portfolio,
i.e. find a small subset of a larger universe of assets that can be used for
long and short positions. We present the full problem formulation, a
specialized algorithm that exploits partial minimization, and numerical
examples using both simulated and empirical price data.

6,Consumption smoothing in the working-class households of interwar Japan,"  I analyze Osaka factory worker households in the early 1920s, whether
idiosyncratic income shocks were shared efficiently, and which consumption
categories were robust to shocks. While the null hypothesis of full
risk-sharing of total expenditures was rejected, factory workers maintained
their households, in that they paid for essential expenditures (rent,
utilities, and commutation) during economic hardship. Additionally, children's
education expenditures were possibly robust to idiosyncratic income shocks. The
results suggest that temporary income is statistically significantly increased
if disposable income drops due to idiosyncratic shocks. Historical documents
suggest microfinancial lending and saving institutions helped mitigate
risk-based vulnerabilities.

7,How to model fake news,"  Over the past three years it has become evident that fake news is a danger to
democracy. However, until now there has been no clear understanding of how to
define fake news, much less how to model it. This paper addresses both these
issues. A definition of fake news is given, and two approaches for the
modelling of fake news and its impact in elections and referendums are
introduced. The first approach, based on the idea of a representative voter, is
shown to be suitable to obtain a qualitative understanding of phenomena
associated with fake news at a macroscopic level. The second approach, based on
the idea of an election microstructure, describes the collective behaviour of
the electorate by modelling the preferences of individual voters. It is shown
through a simulation study that the mere knowledge that pieces of fake news may
be in circulation goes a long way towards mitigating the impact of fake news.

8,Internal migration and education: A cross-national comparison,"  Migration the main process shaping patterns of human settlement within and
between countries. It is widely acknowledged to be integral to the process of
human development as it plays a significant role in enhancing educational
outcomes. At regional and national levels, internal migration underpins the
efficient functioning of the economy by bringing knowledge and skills to the
locations where they are needed. It is the multi-dimensional nature of
migration that underlines its significance in the process of human development.
Human mobility extends in the spatial domain from local travel to international
migration, and in the temporal dimension from short-term stays to permanent
relocations. Classification and measurement of such phenomena is inevitably
complex, which has severely hindered progress in comparative research, with
very few large-scale cross-national comparisons of migration. The linkages
between migration and education have been explored in a separate line of
inquiry that has predominantly focused on country-specific analyses as to the
ways in which migration affects educational outcomes and how educational
attainment affects migration behaviour. A recurrent theme has been the
educational selectivity of migrants, which in turn leads to an increase of
human capital in some regions, primarily cities, at the expense of others.
Questions have long been raised as to the links between education and migration
in response to educational expansion, but have not yet been fully answered
because of the absence, until recently, of adequate data for comparative
analysis of migration. In this paper, we bring these two separate strands of
research together to systematically explore links between internal migration
and education across a global sample of 57 countries at various stages of
development, using data drawn from the IPUMS database.

9,Quantifying macroeconomic expectations in stock markets using Google Trends,"  Among other macroeconomic indicators, the monthly release of U.S.
unemployment rate figures in the Employment Situation report by the U.S. Bureau
of Labour Statistics gets a lot of media attention and strongly affects the
stock markets. I investigate whether a profitable investment strategy can be
constructed by predicting the likely changes in U.S. unemployment before the
official news release using Google query volumes for related search terms. I
find that massive new data sources of human interaction with the Internet not
only improves U.S. unemployment rate predictability, but can also enhance
market timing of trading strategies when considered jointly with macroeconomic
data. My results illustrate the potential of combining extensive behavioural
data sets with economic data to anticipate investor expectations and stock
market moves.

10,Mid-price estimation for European corporate bonds: a particle filtering approach,"  In most illiquid markets, there is no obvious proxy for the market price of
an asset. The European corporate bond market is an archetypal example of such
an illiquid market where mid-prices can only be estimated with a statistical
model. In this OTC market, dealers / market makers only have access, indeed, to
partial information about the market. In real-time, they know the price
associated with their trades on the dealer-to-dealer (D2D) and dealer-to-client
(D2C) markets, they know the result of the requests for quotes (RFQ) they
answered, and they have access to composite prices (e.g., Bloomberg CBBT). This
paper presents a Bayesian method for estimating the mid-price of corporate
bonds by using the real-time information available to a dealer. This method
relies on recent ideas coming from the particle filtering (PF) / sequential
Monte-Carlo (SMC) literature.

11,Nonparametric Bayesian volatility learning under microstructure noise,"  Aiming at financial applications, we study the problem of learning the
volatility under market microstructure noise. Specifically, we consider noisy
discrete time observations from a stochastic differential equation and develop
a novel computational method to learn the diffusion coefficient of the
equation. We take a nonparametric Bayesian approach, where we model the
volatility function a priori as piecewise constant. Its prior is specified via
the inverse Gamma Markov chain. Sampling from the posterior is accomplished by
incorporating the Forward Filtering Backward Simulation algorithm in the Gibbs
sampler. Good performance of the method is demonstrated on two representative
synthetic data examples. Finally, we apply the method on the EUR/USD exchange
rate dataset.

12,From AzÃƒÂ©ma supermartingales of finite honest times to optional semimartingales of class-($ÃŽÂ£$),"  Given a finite honest time, we derive representations for the additive and
multiplicative decomposition of it's AzÃƒÂ©ma supermartingale in terms of
optional supermartingales and its running supremum. We then extend the notion
of semimartingales of class-$(\Sigma)$ to optional semimartingales with jumps
in its finite variation part, allowing one to establish formulas similar to the
Madan-Roynette-Yor option pricing formulas for larger class of processes.
Finally, we introduce the optional multiplicative systems associated with
positive submartingales and apply them to construct random times with given
AzÃƒÂ©ma supermartingale.

13,Asymmetric Connectedness of Fears in the U.S. Financial Sector,"  We study how shocks to the forward-looking expectations of investors buying
call and put options transmit across the financial system. We introduce a new
contagion measure, called asymmetric fear connectedness (AFC), which captures
the information related to ""fear"" on the two sides of the options market and
can be used as a forward-looking systemic risk monitoring tool. The decomposed
connectedness measures provide timely predictive information for near-future
macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty indicators, and they contain
additional valuable information that is not included in the aggregate
connectedness measure. The role of a positive/negative ""fear""
transmitter/receiver emerges clearly when we focus more closely on
idiosyncratic events for financial institutions. We identify banks that are
predominantly positive/negative receivers of ""fear"", as well as banks that
positively/negatively transmit ""fear"" in the financial system.

14,Complex Valued Risk Diversification,"  Risk diversification is one of the dominant concerns for portfolio managers.
Various portfolio constructions have been proposed to minimize the risk of the
portfolio under some constrains including expected returns. We propose a
portfolio construction method that incorporates the complex valued principal
component analysis into the risk diversification portfolio construction. The
proposed method is verified to outperform the conventional risk parity and risk
diversification portfolio constructions.

15,Universal features of price formation in financial markets: perspectives from Deep Learning,"  Using a large-scale Deep Learning approach applied to a high-frequency
database containing billions of electronic market quotes and transactions for
US equities, we uncover nonparametric evidence for the existence of a universal
and stationary price formation mechanism relating the dynamics of supply and
demand for a stock, as revealed through the order book, to subsequent
variations in its market price. We assess the model by testing its
out-of-sample predictions for the direction of price moves given the history of
price and order flow, across a wide range of stocks and time periods. The
universal price formation model is shown to exhibit a remarkably stable
out-of-sample prediction accuracy across time, for a wide range of stocks from
different sectors. Interestingly, these results also hold for stocks which are
not part of the training sample, showing that the relations captured by the
model are universal and not asset-specific.
The universal model --- trained on data from all stocks --- outperforms, in
terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy, asset-specific linear and nonlinear
models trained on time series of any given stock, showing that the universal
nature of price formation weighs in favour of pooling together financial data
from various stocks, rather than designing asset- or sector-specific models as
commonly done. Standard data normalizations based on volatility, price level or
average spread, or partitioning the training data into sectors or categories
such as large/small tick stocks, do not improve training results. On the other
hand, inclusion of price and order flow history over many past observations is
shown to improve forecasting performance, showing evidence of path-dependence
in price dynamics.

16,On maximizing the fundamental frequency of the complement of an obstacle,"  Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded domain satisfying a
Hayman-type asymmetry condition, and let $ D $ be an arbitrary bounded domain
referred to as ""obstacle"". We are interested in the behaviour of the first
Dirichlet eigenvalue $ \lambda_1(\Omega \setminus (x+D)) $. First, we prove an
upper bound on $ \lambda_1(\Omega \setminus (x+D)) $ in terms of the distance
of the set $ x+D $ to the set of maximum points $ x_0 $ of the first Dirichlet
ground state $ \phi_{\lambda_1} > 0 $ of $ \Omega $. In short, a direct
corollary is that if \begin{equation} \mu_\Omega := \max_{x}\lambda_1(\Omega
\setminus (x+D)) \end{equation} is large enough in terms of $ \lambda_1(\Omega)
$, then all maximizer sets $ x+D $ of $ \mu_\Omega $ are close to each maximum
point $ x_0 $ of $ \phi_{\lambda_1} $.
Second, we discuss the distribution of $ \phi_{\lambda_1(\Omega)} $ and the
possibility to inscribe wavelength balls at a given point in $ \Omega $.
Finally, we specify our observations to convex obstacles $ D $ and show that
if $ \mu_\Omega $ is sufficiently large with respect to $ \lambda_1(\Omega) $,
then all maximizers $ x+D $ of $ \mu_\Omega $ contain all maximum points $ x_0
$ of $ \phi_{\lambda_1(\Omega)} $.

17,On the rotation period and shape of the hyperbolic asteroid 1I/`Oumuamua (2017) U1 from its lightcurve,"  We observed the newly discovered hyperbolic minor planet 1I/`Oumuamua (2017
U1) on 2017 October 30 with Lowell Observatory's 4.3-m Discovery Channel
Telescope. From these observations, we derived a partial lightcurve with
peak-to-trough amplitude of at least 1.2 mag. This lightcurve segment rules out
rotation periods less than 3 hr and suggests that the period is at least 5 hr.
On the assumption that the variability is due to a changing cross section, the
axial ratio is at least 3:1. We saw no evidence for a coma or tail in either
individual images or in a stacked image having an equivalent exposure time of
9000 s.

18,Adverse effects of polymer coating on heat transport at solid-liquid interface,"  The ability of metallic nanoparticles to supply heat to a liquid environment
under exposure to an external optical field has attracted growing interest for
biomedical applications. Controlling the thermal transport properties at a
solid-liquid interface then appears to be particularly relevant. In this work,
we address the thermal transport between water and a gold surface coated by a
polymer layer. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that
increasing the polymer density displaces the domain resisting to the heat flow,
while it doesn't affect the final amount of thermal energy released in the
liquid. This unexpected behavior results from a trade-off established by the
increasing polymer density which couples more efficiently with the solid but
initiates a counterbalancing resistance with the liquid.

19,"SPH calculations of Mars-scale collisions: the role of the Equation of State, material rheologies, and numerical effects","  We model large-scale ($\approx$2000km) impacts on a Mars-like planet using a
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code. The effects of material strength and of
using different Equations of State on the post-impact material and temperature
distributions are investigated. The properties of the ejected material in terms
of escaping and disc mass are analysed as well. We also study potential
numerical effects in the context of density discontinuities and rigid body
rotation. We find that in the large-scale collision regime considered here
(with impact velocities of 4km/s), the effect of material strength is
substantial for the post-impact distribution of the temperature and the
impactor material, while the influence of the Equation of State is more subtle
and present only at very high temperatures.

20,$\mathcal{R}_{0}$ fails to predict the outbreak potential in the presence of natural-boosting immunity,"  Time varying susceptibility of host at individual level due to waning and
boosting immunity is known to induce rich long-term behavior of disease
transmission dynamics. Meanwhile, the impact of the time varying heterogeneity
of host susceptibility on the shot-term behavior of epidemics is not
well-studied, even though the large amount of the available epidemiological
data are the short-term epidemics. Here we constructed a parsimonious
mathematical model describing the short-term transmission dynamics taking into
account natural-boosting immunity by reinfection, and obtained the explicit
solution for our model. We found that our system show ""the delayed epidemic"",
the epidemic takes off after negative slope of the epidemic curve at the
initial phase of epidemic, in addition to the common classification in the
standard SIR model, i.e., ""no epidemic"" as $\mathcal{R}_{0}\leq1$ or normal
epidemic as $\mathcal{R}_{0}>1$. Employing the explicit solution we derived the
condition for each classification.

21,A global sensitivity analysis and reduced order models for hydraulically-fractured horizontal wells,"  We present a systematic global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method
which can be utilized to rank the variables that affect two quantity of
interests -- pore pressure depletion and stress change -- around a
hydraulically-fractured horizontal well based on their degree of importance.
These variables include rock properties and stimulation design variables. A
fully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore
pressure and stress changes due to production. To ease the computational cost
of a simulator, we also provide reduced order models (ROMs), which can be used
to replace the complex numerical model with a rather simple analytical model,
for calculating the pore pressure and stresses at different locations around
hydraulic fractures. The main findings of this research are: (i) mobility,
production pressure, and fracture half-length are the main contributors to the
changes in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of
each parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic
fractures and the quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect
of mobility decreases and the effect of production pressure increases. (iii)
These two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses at large
distances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture
tips or inside the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and
half-length are the dominant factors that affect the minimum horizontal stress.
The results of this study will provide useful guidelines for the stimulation
design of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill
drilling.

22,Role-separating ordering in social dilemmas controlled by topological frustration,"  ""Three is a crowd"" is an old proverb that applies as much to social
interactions, as it does to frustrated configurations in statistical physics
models. Accordingly, social relations within a triangle deserve special
attention. With this motivation, we explore the impact of topological
frustration on the evolutionary dynamics of the snowdrift game on a triangular
lattice. This topology provides an irreconcilable frustration, which prevents
anti-coordination of competing strategies that would be needed for an optimal
outcome of the game. By using different strategy updating protocols, we observe
complex spatial patterns in dependence on payoff values that are reminiscent to
a honeycomb-like organization, which helps to minimize the negative consequence
of the topological frustration. We relate the emergence of these patterns to
the microscopic dynamics of the evolutionary process, both by means of
mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. For comparison, we also
consider the same evolutionary dynamics on the square lattice, where of course
the topological frustration is absent. However, with the deletion of diagonal
links of the triangular lattice, we can gradually bridge the gap to the square
lattice. Interestingly, in this case the level of cooperation in the system is
a direct indicator of the level of topological frustration, thus providing a
method to determine frustration levels in an arbitrary interaction network.

23,Dynamics of exciton magnetic polarons in CdMnSe/CdMgSe quantum wells: the effect of self-localization,"  We study the exciton magnetic polaron (EMP) formation in (Cd,Mn)Se/(Cd,Mg)Se
diluted-magnetic-semiconductor quantum wells using time-resolved
photoluminescence (PL). The magnetic field and temperature dependencies of this
dynamics allow us to separate the non-magnetic and magnetic contributions to
the exciton localization. We deduce the EMP energy of 14 meV, which is in
agreement with time-integrated measurements based on selective excitation and
the magnetic field dependence of the PL circular polarization degree. The
polaron formation time of 500 ps is significantly longer than the corresponding
values reported earlier. We propose that this behavior is related to strong
self-localization of the EMP, accompanied with a squeezing of the heavy-hole
envelope wavefunction. This conclusion is also supported by the decrease of the
exciton lifetime from 600 ps to 200 - 400 ps with increasing magnetic field and
temperature.

24,On Varieties of Ordered Automata,"  The classical Eilenberg correspondence, based on the concept of the syntactic
monoid, relates varieties of regular languages with pseudovarieties of finite
monoids. Various modifications of this correspondence appeared, with more
general classes of regular languages on one hand and classes of more complex
algebraic structures on the other hand. For example, classes of languages need
not be closed under complementation or all preimages under homomorphisms, while
monoids can be equipped with a compatible order or they can have a
distinguished set of generators. Such generalized varieties and pseudovarieties
also have natural counterparts formed by classes of finite (ordered) automata.
In this paper the previous approaches are combined. The notion of positive
$\mathcal C$-varieties of ordered semiautomata (i.e. no initial and final
states are specified) is introduced and their correspondence with positive
$\mathcal C$-varieties of languages is proved.

25,Direct Evidence of Spontaneous Abrikosov Vortex State in Ferromagnetic Superconductor EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ with $x=0.21$,"  Using low-temperature Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) we provide direct
experimental evidence for spontaneous vortex phase (SVP) formation in
EuFe$_2$(As$_{0.79}$P$_{0.21}$)$_2$ single crystal with the superconducting
$T^{\rm 0}_{\rm SC}=23.6$~K and ferromagnetic $T_{\rm FM}\sim17.7$~K transition
temperatures. Spontaneous vortex-antivortex (V-AV) pairs are imaged in the
vicinity of $T_{\rm FM}$. Also, upon cooling cycle near $T_{\rm FM}$ we observe
the first-order transition from the short period domain structure, which
appears in the Meissner state, into the long period domain structure with
spontaneous vortices. It is the first experimental observation of this scenario
in the ferromagnetic superconductors. Low-temperature phase is characterized by
much larger domains in V-AV state and peculiar branched striped structures at
the surface, which are typical for uniaxial ferromagnets with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The domain wall parameters at various temperatures
are estimated.

27,The PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS). The Role of Spiral Arms in Cloud and Star Formation,"  The process that leads to the formation of the bright star forming sites
observed along prominent spiral arms remains elusive. We present results of a
multi-wavelength study of a spiral arm segment in the nearby grand-design
spiral galaxy M51 that belongs to a spiral density wave and exhibits nine gas
spurs. The combined observations of the(ionized, atomic, molecular, dusty)
interstellar medium (ISM) with star formation tracers (HII regions, young
<10Myr stellar clusters) suggest (1) no variation in giant molecular cloud
(GMC) properties between arm and gas spurs, (2) gas spurs and extinction
feathers arising from the same structure with a close spatial relation between
gas spurs and ongoing/recent star formation (despite higher gas surface
densities in the spiral arm), (3) no trend in star formation age either along
the arm or along a spur, (4) evidence for strong star formation feedback in gas
spurs: (5) tentative evidence for star formation triggered by stellar feedback
for one spur, and (6) GMC associations (GMAs) being no special entities but the
result of blending of gas arm/spur cross-sections in lower resolution
observations. We conclude that there is no evidence for a coherent star
formation onset mechanism that can be solely associated to the presence of the
spiral density wave. This suggests that other (more localized) mechanisms are
important to delay star formation such that it occurs in spurs. The evidence of
star formation proceeding over several million years within individual spurs
implies that the mechanism that leads to star formation acts or is sustained
over a longer time-scale.

29,Comparing Covariate Prioritization via Matching to Machine Learning Methods for Causal Inference using Five Empirical Applications,"  When investigators seek to estimate causal effects, they often assume that
selection into treatment is based only on observed covariates. Under this
identification strategy, analysts must adjust for observed confounders. While
basic regression models have long been the dominant method of statistical
adjustment, more robust methods based on matching or weighting have become more
common. Of late, even more flexible methods based on machine learning methods
have been developed for statistical adjustment. These machine learning methods
are designed to be black box methods with little input from the researcher.
Recent research used a data competition to evaluate various methods of
statistical adjustment and found that black box methods out performed all other
methods of statistical adjustment. Matching methods with covariate
prioritization are designed for direct input from substantive investigators in
direct contrast to black methods. In this article, we use a different research
design to compare matching with covariate prioritization to black box methods.
We use black box methods to replicate results from five studies where matching
with covariate prioritization was used to customize the statistical adjustment
in direct response to substantive expertise. We find little difference across
the methods. We conclude with advice for investigators.

30,Acoustic Impedance Calculation via Numerical Solution of the Inverse Helmholtz Problem,"  Assigning homogeneous boundary conditions, such as acoustic impedance, to the
thermoviscous wave equations (TWE) derived by transforming the linearized
Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) to the frequency domain yields a so-called
Helmholtz solver, whose output is a discrete set of complex eigenfunction and
eigenvalue pairs. The proposed method -- the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS) --
reverses such procedure by returning the value of acoustic impedance at one or
more unknown impedance boundaries (IBs) of a given domain via spatial
integration of the TWE for a given real-valued frequency with assigned
conditions on other boundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order
spatial discretization of the TWEs derived on an unstructured grid with
staggered grid arrangement. The momentum equation only is extended to the
center of each IB face where pressure and velocity components are co-located
and treated as unknowns. One closure condition considered for the iHS is the
assignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over the IBs,
corresponding to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the IB. The
iHS procedure is carried out independently for each frequency in order to
return the complete broadband complex impedance distribution at the IBs in any
desired frequency range. The iHS approach is first validated against Rott's
theory for both inviscid and viscous, rectangular and circular ducts. The
impedance of a geometrically complex toy cavity is then reconstructed and
verified against companion full compressible unstructured Navier-Stokes
simulations resolving the cavity geometry and one-dimensional impedance test
tube calculations based on time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC).
The iHS methodology is also shown to capture thermoacoustic effects, with
reconstructed impedance values quantitatively in agreement with thermoacoustic
growth rates.

31,Deciphering noise amplification and reduction in open chemical reaction networks,"  The impact of random fluctuations on the dynamical behavior a complex
biological systems is a longstanding issue, whose understanding would shed
light on the evolutionary pressure that nature imposes on the intrinsic noise
levels and would allow rationally designing synthetic networks with controlled
noise. Using the ItÃ…Â stochastic differential equation formalism, we performed
both analytic and numerical analyses of several model systems containing
different molecular species in contact with the environment and interacting
with each other through mass-action kinetics. These systems represent for
example biomolecular oligomerization processes, complex-breakage reactions,
signaling cascades or metabolic networks. For chemical reaction networks with
zero deficiency values, which admit a detailed- or complex-balanced steady
state, all molecular species are uncorrelated. The number of molecules of each
species follow a Poisson distribution and their Fano factors, which measure the
intrinsic noise, are equal to one. Systems with deficiency one have an
unbalanced non-equilibrium steady state and a non-zero S-flux, defined as the
flux flowing between the complexes multiplied by an adequate stoichiometric
coefficient. In this case, the noise on each species is reduced if the flux
flows from the species of lowest to highest complexity, and is amplified is the
flux goes in the opposite direction. These results are generalized to systems
of deficiency two, which possess two independent non-vanishing S-fluxes, and we
conjecture that a similar relation holds for higher deficiency systems.

causal relationship between two time series. We propose a bootstrap test on
unconditional and conditional Granger-causality spectra, as well as on their
difference, to catch particularly prominent causality cycles in relative terms.
In particular, we consider a stochastic process derived applying independently
the stationary bootstrap to the original series. Our null hypothesis is that
each causality or causality difference is equal to the median across
frequencies computed on that process. In this way, we are able to disambiguate
causalities which depart significantly from the median one obtained ignoring
the causality structure. Our test shows power one as the process tends to
non-stationarity, thus being more conservative than parametric alternatives. As
an example, we infer about the relationship between money stock and GDP in the
Euro Area via our approach, considering inflation, unemployment and interest
rates as conditioning variables. We point out that during the period 1999-2017
the money stock aggregate M1 had a significant impact on economic output at all
frequencies, while the opposite relationship is significant only at high
frequencies.

34,Optimal make-take fees for market making regulation,"  We consider an exchange who wishes to set suitable make-take fees to attract
liquidity on its platform. Using a principal-agent approach, we are able to
describe in quasi-explicit form the optimal contract to propose to a market
maker. This contract depends essentially on the market maker inventory
trajectory and on the volatility of the asset. We also provide the optimal
quotes that should be displayed by the market maker. The simplicity of our
formulas allows us to analyze in details the effects of optimal contracting
with an exchange, compared to a situation without contract. We show in
particular that it leads to higher quality liquidity and lower trading costs
for investors.

35,The equivalence of two tax processes,"  We introduce two models of taxation, the latent and natural tax processes,
which have both been used to represent loss-carry-forward taxation on the
capital of an insurance company. In the natural tax process, the tax rate is a
function of the current level of capital, whereas in the latent tax process,
the tax rate is a function of the capital that would have resulted if no tax
had been paid. Whereas up to now these two types of tax processes have been
treated separately, we show that, in fact, they are essentially equivalent.
This allows a unified treatment, translating results from one model to the
other. Significantly, we solve the question of existence and uniqueness for the
natural tax process, which is defined via an integral equation. Our results
clarify the existing literature on processes with tax.

36,A factor-model approach for correlation scenarios and correlation stress-testing,"  In 2012, JPMorgan accumulated a USD~6.2 billion loss on a credit derivatives
portfolio, the so-called `London Whale', partly as a consequence of
de-correlations of non-perfectly correlated positions that were supposed to
hedge each other. Motivated by this case, we devise a factor model for
correlations that allows for scenario-based stress testing of correlations. We
derive a number of analytical results related to a portfolio of homogeneous
assets. Using the concept of Mahalanobis distance, we show how to identify
adverse scenarios of correlation risk. In addition, we demonstrate how
correlation and volatility stress tests can be combined. As an example, we
apply the factor-model approach to the ""London Whale"" portfolio and determine
the value-at-risk impact from correlation changes. Since our findings are
particularly relevant for large portfolios, where even small correlation
changes can have a large impact, a further application would be to stress test
portfolios of central counterparties, which are of systemically relevant size.

martingale if and only if the correlation $\rho$ between the driving Brownian
motions of the stock and the volatility is nonpositive. We also show that for
each $\rho<0$ and $m> \frac{1}{1-\rho^2}$, the $m$-th moment of the stock
price is infinite at each positive time.

38,A Backward Simulation Method for Stochastic Optimal Control Problems,"  A number of optimal decision problems with uncertainty can be formulated into
a stochastic optimal control framework. The Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC)
algorithm is a popular numerical method to approach solutions of such
stochastic control problems as analytical solutions are not tractable in
general. This paper generalizes the LSMC algorithm proposed in Shen and Weng
(2017) to solve a wide class of stochastic optimal control models. Our
algorithm has three pillars: a construction of auxiliary stochastic control
model, an artificial simulation of the post-action value of state process, and
a shape-preserving sieve estimation method which equip the algorithm with a
number of merits including bypassing forward simulation and control
randomization, evading extrapolating the value function, and alleviating
computational burden of the tuning parameter selection. The efficacy of the
algorithm is corroborated by an application to pricing equity-linked insurance
products.

39,Classes of elementary function solutions to the CEV model. I,"  The CEV model subsumes some of the previous option pricing models. An
important parameter in the model is the parameter b, the elasticity of
volatility. For b=0, b=-1/2, and b=-1 the CEV model reduces respectively to the
BSM model, the square-root model of Cox and Ross, and the Bachelier model. Both
in the case of the BSM model and in the case of the CEV model it has become
traditional to begin a discussion of option pricing by starting with the
vanilla European calls and puts. In the case of BSM model simpler solutions are
the log and power solutions. These contracts, despite the simplicity of their
mathematical description, are attracting increasing attention as a trading
instrument. Similar simple solutions have not been studied so far in a
systematic fashion for the CEV model. We use Kovacic's algorithm to derive, for
all half-integer values of b, all solutions ""in quadratures"" of the CEV
ordinary differential equation. These solutions give rise, by separation of
variables, to simple solutions to the CEV partial differential equation. In
particular, when b=...,-5/2,-2,-3/2,-1, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2,..., we obtain four
classes of denumerably infinite elementary function solutions, when b=-1/2 and
b=1/2 we obtain two classes of denumerably infinite elementary function
solutions, whereas, when b=0 we find two elementary function solutions. In the
derived solutions we have also dispensed with the unnecessary assumption made
in the the BSM model asserting that the underlying asset pays no dividends
during the life of the option.

40,A dynamic network model to measure exposure diversification in the Austrian interbank market,"  We propose a statistical model for weighted temporal networks capable of
measuring the level of heterogeneity in a financial system. Our model focuses
on the level of diversification of financial institutions; that is, whether
they are more inclined to distribute their assets equally among partners, or if
they rather concentrate their commitment towards a limited number of
institutions. Crucially, a Markov property is introduced to capture time
dependencies and to make our measures comparable across time. We apply the
model on an original dataset of Austrian interbank exposures. The temporal span
encompasses the onset and development of the financial crisis in 2008 as well
as the beginnings of European sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Our analysis
highlights an overall increasing trend for network homogeneity, whereby core
banks have a tendency to distribute their market exposures more equally across
their partners.

41,Fast mean-reversion asymptotics for large portfolios of stochastic volatility models,"  We consider a large portfolio limit where the asset prices evolve according
certain stochastic volatility models with default upon hitting a lower barrier.
When the asset prices and the volatilities are correlated via systemic Brownian
Motions, that limit exist and it is described by a SPDE on the positive
half-space with Dirichlet boundary conditions which has been studied in
\cite{HK17}. We study the convergence of the total mass of a solution to this
stochastic initial-boundary value problem when the mean-reversion coefficients
of the volatilities are multiples of a parameter that tends to infinity. When
the volatilities of the volatilities are multiples of the square root of the
same parameter, the convergence is extremely weak. On the other hand, when the
volatilities of the volatilities are independent of this exploding parameter,
the volatilities converge to their means and we can have much better
approximations. Our aim is to use such approximations to improve the accuracy
of certain risk-management methods in markets where fast volatility
mean-reversion is observed.

42,Game-theoretic dynamic investment model with incomplete information: futures contracts,"  Over the past few years, the futures market has been successfully developing
in the North-West region. Futures markets are one of the most effective and
liquid-visible trading mechanisms. A large number of buyers are forced to
compete with each other and raise their prices. A large number of sellers make
them reduce prices. Thus, the gap between the prices of offers of buyers and
sellers is reduced due to high competition, and this is a good criterion for
the liquidity of the market. This high degree of liquidity contributed to the
fact that futures trading took such an important role in commerce and finance.

finite horizon. We assume that the drift of the stock is following
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the volatility of it is following GARCH(1)
process. In particular, both mean and volatility are unbounded. We assume that
there is Knightian uncertainty on the parameters of both mean and volatility.
We take that the investor has logarithmic utility function, and solve the
corresponding utility maximization problem explicitly. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work on utility maximization with unbounded mean

that can maximize the net present value for portfolios containing multiple
development projects. Replica analysis was developed in statistical mechanical
informatics and econophysics to evaluate disordered systems, and here we use it
to formulate the maximization of the net present value as an optimization
problem under budget and investment concentration constraints. Furthermore, we
confirm that a common approach from operations research underestimates the true
maximal net present value as the maximal expected net present value by
comparing our results with the maximal expected net present value as derived in
operations research. Moreover, it is shown that the conventional method for
estimating the net present value does not consider variance in the cash flow.

45,Accounting Noise and the Pricing of CoCos,"  Contingent Convertible bonds (CoCos) are debt instruments that convert into
equity or are written down in times of distress. Existing pricing models assume
conversion triggers based on market prices and on the assumption that markets
can always observe all relevant firm information. But all Cocos issued so far
have triggers based on accounting ratios and/or regulatory intervention. We
incorporate that markets receive information through noisy accounting reports
issued at discrete time instants, which allows us to distinguish between market
and accounting values, and between automatic triggers and regulator-mandated
conversions. Our second contribution is to incorporate that coupon payments are
contingent too: their payment is conditional on the Maximum Distributable
Amount not being exceeded. We examine the impact of CoCo design parameters,
asset volatility and accounting noise on the price of a CoCo; and investigate
the interaction between CoCo design features, the capital structure of the
issuing bank and their implications for risk taking and investment incentives.
Finally, we use our model to explain the crash in CoCo prices after Deutsche
Bank's profit warning in February 2016.

46,Exploiting Investors Social Network for Stock Prediction in China's Market,"  Recent works have shown that social media platforms are able to influence the
trends of stock price movements. However, existing works have majorly focused
on the U.S. stock market and lacked attention to certain emerging countries
such as China, where retail investors dominate the market. In this regard, as
retail investors are prone to be influenced by news or other social media,
psychological and behavioral features extracted from social media platforms are
thought to well predict stock price movements in the China's market. Recent
advances in the investor social network in China enables the extraction of such
features from web-scale data. In this paper, on the basis of tweets from
Xueqiu, a popular Chinese Twitter-like social platform specialized for
investors, we analyze features with regard to collective sentiment and
perception on stock relatedness and predict stock price movements by employing
nonlinear models. The features of interest prove to be effective in our
experiments.

47,The role of complex analysis in modeling economic growth,"  Development and growth are complex and tumultuous processes. Modern economic
growth theories identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the
relative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional
variables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions.
The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate
measures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and
structural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their
capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in
explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ
economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex
network techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more
traditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth
theories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement
with other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in
fostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be
either complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely
overshadow them.

48,"Optimal Investment, Demand and Arbitrage under Price Impact","  This paper studies the optimal investment problem with random endowment in an
inventory-based price impact model with competitive market makers. Our goal is
to analyze how price impact affects optimal policies, as well as both pricing
rules and demand schedules for contingent claims. For exponential market makers
preferences, we establish two effects due to price impact: constrained trading,
and non-linear hedging costs. To the former, wealth processes in the impact
model are identified with those in a model without impact, but with constrained
trading, where the (random) constraint set is generically neither closed nor
convex. Regarding hedging, non-linear hedging costs motivate the study of
arbitrage free prices for the claim. We provide three such notions, which
coincide in the frictionless case, but which dramatically differ in the
presence of price impact. Additionally, we show arbitrage opportunities, should
they arise from claim prices, can be exploited only for limited position sizes,
and may be ignored if outweighed by hedging considerations. We also show that
arbitrage inducing prices may arise endogenously in equilibrium, and that
equilibrium positions are inversely proportional to the market makers'
representative risk aversion. Therefore, large positions endogenously arise in
the limit of either market maker risk neutrality, or a large number of market
makers.

market view on the terminal asset price distribution and uninformative noise
embedded in the asset price dynamics. We model the underlying asset price
evolution by an exponential randomized Brownian bridge (rBb) and consider
various prior distributions for the random endpoint. We solve for the optimal
strategies to sell a stock, call, or put, and analyze the associated delayed
liquidation premia. We solve for the optimal trading strategies numerically and
compare them across different prior beliefs. Among our results, we find that
disconnected continuation/exercise regions arise when the trader prescribe a
two-point discrete distribution and double exponential distribution.

51,Complexity of Deciding Detectability in Discrete Event Systems,"  Detectability of discrete event systems (DESs) is a question whether the
current and subsequent states can be determined based on observations. Shu and
Lin designed a polynomial-time algorithm to check strong (periodic)
detectability and an exponential-time (polynomial-space) algorithm to check
weak (periodic) detectability. Zhang showed that checking weak (periodic)
detectability is PSpace-complete. This intractable complexity opens a question
whether there are structurally simpler DESs for which the problem is tractable.
In this paper, we show that it is not the case by considering DESs represented
as deterministic finite automata without non-trivial cycles, which are
structurally the simplest deadlock-free DESs. We show that even for such very
simple DESs, checking weak (periodic) detectability remains intractable. On the
contrary, we show that strong (periodic) detectability of DESs can be
efficiently verified on a parallel computer.

subset of $X$ has a supremum. Then we apply the above result to prove that if
$X$ is a topological space with a partial order $\preceq $ for which the order
intervals are compact, $\mathcal{F}$ a nonempty commutative family of monotone
maps from $X$ into $X$ and there exists $c\in X$ such that $c\preceq Tc$ for
every $T\in \mathcal{F}$, then the set of common fixed points of $\mathcal{F}$
is nonempty and has a maximal element. The result, specialized to the case of
Banach spaces gives a general fixed point theorem that drops almost all
assumptions from the recent results in this area. An application to the theory
of integral equations of Urysohn's type is also given.

54,Diffraction-Aware Sound Localization for a Non-Line-of-Sight Source,"  We present a novel sound localization algorithm for a non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) sound source in indoor environments. Our approach exploits the
diffraction properties of sound waves as they bend around a barrier or an
obstacle in the scene. We combine a ray tracing based sound propagation
algorithm with a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model, which simulate
bending effects by placing a virtual sound source on a wedge in the
environment. We precompute the wedges of a reconstructed mesh of an indoor
scene and use them to generate diffraction acoustic rays to localize the 3D
position of the source. Our method identifies the convergence region of those
generated acoustic rays as the estimated source position based on a particle
filter. We have evaluated our algorithm in multiple scenarios consisting of a
static and dynamic NLOS sound source. In our tested cases, our approach can
localize a source position with an average accuracy error, 0.7m, measured by
the L2 distance between estimated and actual source locations in a 7m*7m*3m
room. Furthermore, we observe 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over a
state-of-the-art localization method that does not model diffraction effects,
especially when a sound source is not visible to the robot.

the possibility of deploying small cells served by base stations mounted on
flying drones. A major advantage of such drone small cells is that the
operators can quickly provide cellular services in areas of urgent demand
without having to pre-install any infrastructure. Since the base station is
attached to the drone, technically it is feasible for the base station to
dynamic reposition itself in response to the changing locations of users for
reducing the communication distance, decreasing the probability of signal
blocking, and ultimately increasing the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we
first propose distributed algorithms for autonomous control of drone movements,
and then model and analyse the spectral efficiency performance of a drone small
cell to shed new light on the fundamental benefits of dynamic repositioning. We
show that, with dynamic repositioning, the spectral efficiency of drone small
cells can be increased by nearly 100\% for realistic drone speed, height, and
user traffic model and without incurring any major increase in drone energy

showed a feasibility of implementing such operations with high energy
efficiency, thus there are many works on efficiently utilizing emerging NVM
crossbar array as analog vector-matrix multiplier. However, its nonlinear I-V
characteristics restrain critical design parameters, such as the read voltage
and weight range, resulting in substantial accuracy loss. In this paper,
instead of optimizing hardware parameters to a given neural network, we propose
a methodology of reconstructing a neural network itself optimized to resistive
memory crossbar arrays. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we
simulated various neural network with MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset using two
different specific Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) model. Simulation
results show that our proposed neural network produces significantly higher
inference accuracies than conventional neural network when the synapse devices

two-component thermal plasma models: The soft component is in ionization
equilibrium and has a temperature $\sim$0.59 keV, while the hard component has
temperature $\sim$3.2 keV and ionization time-scale $\sim$$2.6\times10^{10}$
cm$^{-3}$ s. We clearly detected Fe K-shell line at energy of $\sim$6.5 keV
from this remnant. The overabundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe confirm that the
X-ray emission has an ejecta origin. The centroid energy of the Fe-K line
supports that G306.3$-$0.9 is a remnant of a Type Ia supernova (SN) rather than
a core-collapse SN. The GeV gamma-ray emission from G306.3$-$0.9 and its

the non-detection of G306.3$-$0.9 and the detection of a new extended gamma-ray

64,"Covariances, Robustness, and Variational Bayes","  Mean-field Variational Bayes (MFVB) is an approximate Bayesian posterior
inference technique that is increasingly popular due to its fast runtimes on
large-scale datasets. However, even when MFVB provides accurate posterior means
for certain parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances.
Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By
deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations
on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and
local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical
usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior
covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature
relating derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and
include the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that
the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior
means---an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methods are simple, general, and
fast, providing accurate posterior uncertainty estimates and robustness
measures with runtimes that can be an order of magnitude faster than MCMC.

candidate of a valley filter, in which the polarization of the valley degree of
freedom can be selected by using a local gate voltage. Here, we propose to
detect the valley filtering effect by Andreev reflection. Because electrons in
the lowest conduction band and the highest valence band of the BPC possess
opposite chirality, the inter-band Andreev reflection is strongly suppressed,
after multiple scattering and interference. We draw this conclusion by both the
scattering matrix analysis and the numerical simulation. The Andreev reflection
as a function of the incident energy of electrons and the local gate voltage at
the BPC is obtained, by which the parameter region for a perfect valley filter
and the direction of valley polarization can be determined. The Andreev
reflection exhibits an oscillatory decay with the length of the BPC, indicating
a negative correlation to valley polarization.

67,LAAIR: A Layered Architecture for Autonomous Interactive Robots,"  When developing general purpose robots, the overarching software architecture
can greatly affect the ease of accomplishing various tasks. Initial efforts to
create unified robot systems in the 1990s led to hybrid architectures,
emphasizing a hierarchy in which deliberative plans direct the use of reactive
skills. However, since that time there has been significant progress in the
low-level skills available to robots, including manipulation and perception,
making it newly feasible to accomplish many more tasks in real-world domains.
There is thus renewed optimism that robots will be able to perform a wide array
of tasks while maintaining responsiveness to human operators. However, the top
layer in traditional hybrid architectures, designed to achieve long-term goals,
can make it difficult to react quickly to human interactions during goal-driven
execution. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a novel architecture that
supports such transitions by adding a top-level reactive module which has
flexible access to both reactive skills and a deliberative control module. To
validate this architecture, we present a case study of its application on a

depth. Our approach builds on robust human keypoint detectors for color images
and incorporates depth for lifting into 3D. We combine the system with our
learning from demonstration framework to instruct a service robot without the
need of markers. Experiments in real world settings demonstrate that our
approach enables a PR2 robot to imitate manipulation actions observed from a
human teacher.

69,Simultaneous non-vanishing for Dirichlet L-functions,"  We extend the work of Fouvry, Kowalski and Michel on correlation between
Hecke eigenvalues of modular forms and algebraic trace functions in order to
establish an asymptotic formula for a generalized cubic moment of modular
L-functions at the central point s = 1/2 and for prime moduli q. As an
application, we exploit our recent result on the mollification of the fourth
moment of Dirichlet L-functions to derive that for any pair
$(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ of multiplicative characters modulo q, there is a
positive proportion of $\chi$ (mod q) such that $L(\chi, 1/2 ), L(\chi\omega_1,
1/2 )$ and $L(\chi\omega_2, 1/2)$ are simultaneously not too small.

70,Attention-based Natural Language Person Retrieval,"  Following the recent progress in image classification and captioning using
deep learning, we develop a novel natural language person retrieval system
based on an attention mechanism. More specifically, given the description of a
person, the goal is to localize the person in an image. To this end, we first
construct a benchmark dataset for natural language person retrieval. To do so,
we generate bounding boxes for persons in a public image dataset from the
segmentation masks, which are then annotated with descriptions and attributes
using the Amazon Mechanical Turk. We then adopt a region proposal network in
Faster R-CNN as a candidate region generator. The cropped images based on the
region proposals as well as the whole images with attention weights are fed
into Convolutional Neural Networks for visual feature extraction, while the
natural language expression and attributes are input to Bidirectional Long
Short- Term Memory (BLSTM) models for text feature extraction. The visual and
text features are integrated to score region proposals, and the one with the
highest score is retrieved as the output of our system. The experimental
results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method for
generic object retrieval and this line of research promises to benefit search
in surveillance video footage.

the absence of phase backaction, an $N$-time correlator can be expressed as a
product of two-time correlators when $N$ is even. For odd $N$, there is a
similar factorization, which also includes a single-time average. Theoretical
predictions agree well with experimental results for two detectors, which
simultaneously measure non-commuting qubit observables.

73,"Parallelism, Concurrency and Distribution in Constraint Handling Rules: A Survey","  Constraint Handling Rules is an effective concurrent declarative programming
language and a versatile computational logic formalism. CHR programs consist of
guarded reactive rules that transform multisets of constraints. One of the main
features of CHR is its inherent concurrency. Intuitively, rules can be applied
to parts of a multiset in parallel. In this comprehensive survey, we give an
overview of concurrent and parallel as well as distributed CHR semantics,
standard and more exotic, that have been proposed over the years at various
levels of refinement. These semantics range from the abstract to the concrete.
They are related by formal soundness results. Their correctness is established
as correspondence between parallel and sequential computations. We present
common concise sample CHR programs that have been widely used in experiments
and benchmarks. We review parallel CHR implementations in software and
hardware. The experimental results obtained show a consistent parallel speedup.
Most implementations are available online. The CHR formalism can also be used
to implement and reason with models for concurrency. To this end, the Software
Transaction Model, the Actor Model, Colored Petri Nets and the Join-Calculus

74,Robustness against the channel effect in pathological voice detection,"  Many people are suffering from voice disorders, which can adversely affect
the quality of their lives. In response, some researchers have proposed
algorithms for automatic assessment of these disorders, based on voice signals.
However, these signals can be sensitive to the recording devices. Indeed, the
channel effect is a pervasive problem in machine learning for healthcare. In
this study, we propose a detection system for pathological voice, which is
robust against the channel effect. This system is based on a bidirectional LSTM
network. To increase the performance robustness against channel mismatch, we
integrate domain adversarial training (DAT) to eliminate the differences
between the devices. When we train on data recorded on a high-quality
microphone and evaluate on smartphone data without labels, our robust detection
system increases the PR-AUC from 0.8448 to 0.9455 (and 0.9522 with target
sample labels). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying
unsupervised domain adaptation to pathological voice detection. Notably, our
system does not need target device sample labels, which allows for
generalization to many new devices.

75,An Effective Framework for Constructing Exponent Lattice Basis of Nonzero Algebraic Numbers,"  Computing a basis for the exponent lattice of algebraic numbers is a basic
problem in the field of computational number theory with applications to many
other areas. The main cost of a well-known algorithm
\cite{ge1993algorithms,kauers2005algorithms} solving the problem is on
computing the primitive element of the extended field generated by the given
algebraic numbers. When the extended field is of large degree, the problem
seems intractable by the tool implementing the algorithm. In this paper, a
special kind of exponent lattice basis is introduced. An important feature of
the basis is that it can be inductively constructed, which allows us to deal
with the given algebraic numbers one by one when computing the basis. Based on
this, an effective framework for constructing exponent lattice basis is
proposed. Through computing a so-called pre-basis first and then solving some
linear Diophantine equations, the basis can be efficiently constructed. A new
certificate for multiplicative independence and some techniques for decreasing
degrees of algebraic numbers are provided to speed up the computation. The new
algorithm has been implemented with Mathematica and its effectiveness is
verified by testing various examples. Moreover, the algorithm is applied to
program verification for finding invariants of linear loops.

76,Competing evolutionary paths in growing populations with applications to multidrug resistance,"  Investigating the emergence of a particular cell type is a recurring theme in
models of growing cellular populations. The evolution of resistance to therapy
is a classic example. Common questions are: when does the cell type first
occur, and via which sequence of steps is it most likely to emerge? For growing
populations, these questions can be formulated in a general framework of
branching processes spreading through a graph from a root to a target vertex.
Cells have a particular fitness value on each vertex and can transition along
edges at specific rates. Vertices represents cell states, say \mic{genotypes
}or physical locations, while possible transitions are acquiring a mutation or
cell migration. We focus on the setting where cells at the root vertex have the
highest fitness and transition rates are small. Simple formulas are derived for
the time to reach the target vertex and for the probability that it is reached
along a given path in the graph. We demonstrate our results on \mic{several
scenarios relevant to the emergence of drug resistance}, including: the
orderings of resistance-conferring mutations in bacteria and the impact of
imperfect drug penetration in cancer.

77,Transient flows in active porous media,"  Stimuli-responsive materials that modify their shape in response to changes
in environmental conditions -- such as solute concentration, temperature, pH,
and stress -- are widespread in nature and technology. Applications include
micro- and nanoporous materials used in filtration and flow control. The
physiochemical mechanisms that induce internal volume modifications have been
widely studies. The coupling between induced volume changes and solute
transport through porous materials, however, is not well understood. Here, we
consider advective and diffusive transport through a small channel linking two
large reservoirs. A section of stimulus-responsive material regulates the
channel permeability, which is a function of the local solute concentration. We
derive an exact solution to the coupled transport problem and demonstrate the
existence of a flow regime in which the steady state is reached via a damped
oscillation around the equilibrium concentration value. Finally, the
feasibility of an experimental observation of the phenomena is discussed.

78,An information model for modular robots: the Hardware Robot Information Model (HRIM),"  Today's landscape of robotics is dominated by vertical integration where
single vendors develop the final product leading to slow progress, expensive
products and customer lock-in. Opposite to this, an horizontal integration
would result in a rapid development of cost-effective mass-market products with
an additional consumer empowerment. The transition of an industry from vertical
integration to horizontal integration is typically catalysed by de facto
industry standards that enable a simplified and seamless integration of
products. However, in robotics there is currently no leading candidate for a
global plug-and-play standard.
This paper tackles the problem of incompatibility between robot components
that hinder the reconfigurability and flexibility demanded by the robotics
industry. Particularly, it presents a model to create plug-and-play robot
hardware components. Rather than iteratively evolving previous ontologies, our
proposed model answers the needs identified by the industry while facilitating
interoperability, measurability and comparability of robotics technology. Our
approach differs significantly with the ones presented before as it is
hardware-oriented and establishes a clear set of actions towards the
integration of this model in real environments and with real manufacturers.

below 4 K, where the width of magnetic field distribution increases as the
temperature is decreased. The measured broadening at mK temperatures suggests a
large London penetration depth in the $ab$ plane ($\lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim

both native and fibrils, and their water environment by intense terahertz time
domain spectroscopy. With the aid of a rigorous dielectric model, we determine
the amplitude and phase of the oscillating dipole induced by the THz field in
the volume containing the protein and its hydration water. At low
concentrations, the amplitude of this induced dipolar response decreases with
increasing concentration. Beyond a certain threshold, marking the onset of the
interactions between the extended hydration shells, the amplitude remains fixed
but the phase of the induced dipolar response, which is initially in phase with
the applied THz field, begins to change. The changes observed in the THz
response reveal protein-protein interactions me-diated by extended hydration
layers, which may control fibril formation and may have an important role in
chemical recognition phenomena.

two-tone spectroscopy, the energies of the six lowest levels of each circuit
are determined. We find huge Lamb shifts that exceed 90% of the bare qubit

85,Deep Multiple Instance Feature Learning via Variational Autoencoder,"  We describe a novel weakly supervised deep learning framework that combines
both the discriminative and generative models to learn meaningful
representation in the multiple instance learning (MIL) setting. MIL is a weakly
supervised learning problem where labels are associated with groups of
instances (referred as bags) instead of individual instances. To address the
essential challenge in MIL problems raised from the uncertainty of positive
instances label, we use a discriminative model regularized by variational
autoencoders (VAEs) to maximize the differences between latent representations
of all instances and negative instances. As a result, the hidden layer of the
variational autoencoder learns meaningful representation. This representation
can effectively be used for MIL problems as illustrated by better performance
on the standard benchmark datasets comparing to the state-of-the-art
approaches. More importantly, unlike most related studies, the proposed
framework can be easily scaled to large dataset problems, as illustrated by the
audio event detection and segmentation task. Visualization also confirms the
effectiveness of the latent representation in discriminating positive and
negative classes.

$X$. Assume that $\overline M$ admits a holomorphic $S^1$-action preserving the
boundary $X$ and the $S^1$-action is transversal and CR on $X$. We show that
the $\overline\partial$-Neumann Laplacian on $M$ is transversally elliptic and
as a consequence, the $m$-th Fourier component of the $q$-th Dolbeault
cohomology group $H^q_m(\overline M)$ is finite dimensional, for every
$m\in\mathbb Z$ and every $q=0,1,\ldots,n$. This enables us to define
$\sum^{n}_{j=0}(-1)^j{\rm dim\,}H^q_m(\overline M)$ the $m$-th Fourier
component of the Euler characteristic on $M$ and to study large $m$-behavior of
$H^q_m(\overline M)$. In this paper, we establish an index formula for

89,The nature of the tensor order in Cd2Re2O7,"  The pyrochlore metal Cd2Re2O7 has been recently investigated by
second-harmonic generation (SHG) reflectivity. In this paper, we develop a
general formalism that allows for the identification of the relevant tensor
components of the SHG from azimuthal scans. We demonstrate that the secondary
order parameter identified by SHG at the structural phase transition is the
x2-y2 component of the axial toroidal quadrupole. This differs from the 3z2-r2
symmetry of the atomic displacements associated with the I-4m2 crystal
structure that was previously thought to be its origin. Within the same
formalism, we suggest that the primary order parameter detected in the SHG
experiment is the 3z2-r2 component of the magnetic quadrupole. We discuss the
general mechanism driving the phase transition in our proposed framework, and
suggest experiments, particularly resonant X-ray scattering ones, that could
clarify this issue.

90,Pattern-forming fronts in a Swift-Hohenberg equation with directional quenching - parallel and oblique stripes,"  We study the effect of domain growth on the orientation of striped phases in
a Swift-Hohenberg equation. Domain growth is encoded in a step-like parameter
dependence that allows stripe formation in a half plane, and suppresses
patterns in the complement, while the boundary of the pattern-forming region is
propagating with fixed normal velocity. We construct front solutions that leave
behind stripes in the pattern-forming region that are parallel to or at a small
oblique angle to the boundary.
Technically, the construction of stripe formation parallel to the boundary
relies on ill-posed, infinite-dimensional spatial dynamics. Stripes forming at
a small oblique angle are constructed using a functional-analytic, perturbative
approach. Here, the main difficulties are the presence of continuous spectrum
and the fact that small oblique angles appear as a singular perturbation in a
traveling-wave problem. We resolve the former difficulty using a farfield-core
decomposition and Fredholm theory in weighted spaces. The singular perturbation
problem is resolved using preconditioners and boot-strapping.

91,Live Service Migration in Mobile Edge Clouds,"  Mobile edge clouds (MECs) bring the benefits of the cloud closer to the user,
by installing small cloud infrastructures at the network edge. This enables a
new breed of real-time applications, such as instantaneous object recognition
and safety assistance in intelligent transportation systems, that require very
low latency. One key issue that comes with proximity is how to ensure that
users always receive good performance as they move across different locations.
Migrating services between MECs is seen as the means to achieve this. This
article presents a layered framework for migrating active service applications
that are encapsulated either in virtual machines (VMs) or containers. This
layering approach allows a substantial reduction in service downtime. The
framework is easy to implement using readily available technologies, and one of
its key advantages is that it supports containers, which is a promising
emerging technology that offers tangible benefits over VMs. The migration
performance of various real applications is evaluated by experiments under the
presented framework. Insights drawn from the experimentation results are

92,Induced density correlations in a sonic black hole condensate,"  Analog black/white hole pairs, consisting of a region of supersonic flow,
have been achieved in a recent experiment by J. Steinhauer using an elongated
Bose-Einstein condensate. A growing standing density wave, and a checkerboard
feature in the density-density correlation function, were observed in the
supersonic region. We model the density-density correlation function, taking
into account both quantum fluctuations and the shot-to-shot variation of atom
number normally present in ultracold-atom experiments. We find that quantum
fluctuations alone produce some, but not all, of the features of the
correlation function, whereas atom-number fluctuation alone can produce all the
observed features, and agreement is best when both are included. In both cases,
the density-density correlation is not intrinsic to the fluctuations, but
rather is induced by modulation of the standing wave caused by the
fluctuations.

Let $K_n$ be the corresponding subextension with Galois group
$\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ and genus $g_n$. In this paper, we give a simple
explicit formula $g_n$ in terms of an explicit Witt vector construction of the
$\mathbb{Z}_p$-tower. This formula leads to a tight lower bound on $g_n$ which
is quadratic in $p^n$. Furthermore, we determine all $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers for
which the genus sequence is stable, in the sense that there are $a,b,c \in
\mathbb{Q}$ such that $g_n=a p^{2n}+b p^n +c$ for $n$ large enough. Such genus
stable towers are expected to have strong stable arithmetic properties for
their zeta functions. A key technical contribution of this work is a new

problem has been formalized as a sequence extrapolation problem, where a number

simplifying the construction of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.
RNN transducer (RNN-T) is one of the popular end-to-end methods. Previous
studies have shown that RNN-T is difficult to train and a very complex training
process is needed for a reasonable performance. In this paper, we explore RNN-T
for a Chinese large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task and
aim to simplify the training process while maintaining performance. First, a
new strategy of learning rate decay is proposed to accelerate the model
convergence. Second, we find that adding convolutional layers at the beginning
of the network and using ordered data can discard the pre-training process of
the encoder without loss of performance. Besides, we design experiments to find
a balance among the usage of GPU memory, training circle and model performance.
Finally, we achieve 16.9% character error rate (CER) on our test set which is
2% absolute improvement from a strong BLSTM CE system with language model

97,A Debt-Aware Learning Approach for Resource Adaptations in Cloud Elasticity Management,"  Elasticity is a cloud property that enables applications and its execution
systems to dynamically acquire and release shared computational resources on
demand. Moreover, it unfolds the advantage of economies of scale in the cloud
through a drop in the average costs of these shared resources. However, it is
still an open challenge to achieve a perfect match between resource demand and
provision in autonomous elasticity management. Resource adaptation decisions
essentially involve a trade-off between economics and performance, which
produces a gap between the ideal and actual resource provisioning. This gap, if
not properly managed, can negatively impact the aggregate utility of a cloud
customer in the long run. To address this limitation, we propose a technical
debt-aware learning approach for autonomous elasticity management based on a
reinforcement learning of elasticity debts in resource provisioning; the
adaptation pursues strategic decisions that trades off economics against
performance. We extend CloudSim and Burlap to evaluate our approach. The
evaluation shows that a reinforcement learning of technical debts in elasticity
obtains a higher utility for a cloud customer, while conforming expected levels
of performance.

It has also been shown that transformation optics can be used to gravitational

to linear devices, as a consistent approach to nonlinearity (including both the
case of a nonlinear background medium and a nonlinear transformation) remains

of novel effects, including cloaking an optical soliton, modeling nonlinear
solutions to Einstein's field equations, controlling transport in a Debye

upper bounds of the scaling regime. On the basis of our result, the existence
of the lower and upper bounds is expected to be universal or model-independent:
the present simple simulation model provides generic insight into the physics
of crack propagation, and the model will be a first step towards the
development of a more refined coarse-grained model. Relatively abrupt changes
of velocity are predicted near the lower and upper bounds for the scaling
regime and the positions of the bounds could be good markers for the
development of tough polymers, for which we provide simple views that could be
useful as guiding principles for toughening polymer-based materials.

102,A note on the fundamental group of Kodaira fibrations,"  The fundamental group $\pi$ of a Kodaira fibration is, by definition, the
extension of a surface group $\Pi_b$ by another surface group $\Pi_g$, i.e. \[
1 \rightarrow \Pi_g \rightarrow \pi \rightarrow \Pi_b \rightarrow 1. \]
Conversely, we can inquire about what conditions need to be satisfied by a
group of that sort in order to be the fundamental group of a Kodaira fibration.
In this short note we collect some restriction on the image of the classifying
map $m \colon \Pi_b \to \Gamma_g$ in terms of the coinvariant homology of
$\Pi_g$. In particular, we observe that if $\pi$ is the fundamental group of a
Kodaira fibration with relative irregularity $g-s$, then $g \leq 1+ 6s$, and we
show that this effectively constrains the possible choices for $\pi$, namely
that there are group extensions as above that fail to satisfy this bound, hence
cannot be the fundamental group of a Kodaira fibration. In particular this
provides examples of symplectic $4$--manifolds that fail to admit a KÃƒÂ¤hler
structure for reasons that eschew the usual obstructions.

material are used in a variety of electronics applications. However, a
competitive CNT-based technology requires the precise placement of CNTs at
predefined locations of a substrate. One promising placement approach is to use
chemical recognition to bind CNTs from solution at the desired locations on a

we describe a one-step patterning approach based on a highly photosensitive
surface monolayer. The monolayer contains chromophopric group as light
sensitive body with heteroatoms as high quantum yield photolysis center. As
deposited, the layer will bind CNTs from solution. However, when exposed to
ultraviolet (UV) light with a low dose (60 mJ/cm2) similar to that used for
conventional photoresists, the monolayer cleaves and no longer binds CNTs.
These features allow standard, wafer-scale UV lithography processes to be used
to form a patterned chemical monolayer without the need for complex substrate

efficiently the parameter to infer as well as the hyperparameters of the

confidence intervals at a low cost contrary to optimization methods.
Simulations on two often-studied signal processing problems illustrate the
performance of the two proposed samplers. All results are compared to those
obtained by recent state-of-the-art optimization and MCMC algorithms used to

105,Does a generalized Chaplygin gas correctly describe the cosmological dark sector?,"  Yes, but only for a parameter value that makes it almost coincide with the
standard model. We reconsider the cosmological dynamics of a generalized
Chaplygin gas (gCg) which is split into a cold dark matter (CDM) part and a
dark energy (DE) component with constant equation of state. This model, which
implies a specific interaction between CDM and DE, has a $\Lambda$CDM limit and
provides the basis for studying deviations from the latter. Including matter
and radiation, we use the (modified) CLASS code \cite{class} to construct the
CMB and matter power spectra in order to search for a gCg-based concordance
model that is in agreement with the SNIa data from the JLA sample and with
recent Planck data. The results reveal that the gCg parameter $\alpha$ is
restricted to $|\alpha|\lesssim 0.05$, i.e., to values very close to the
$\Lambda$CDM limit $\alpha =0$. This excludes, in particular, models in which
DE decays linearly with the Hubble rate.

106,The effects of subdiffusion on the NTA size measurements of extracellular vesicles in biological samples,"  The interest in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as they
became reliable biomarkers for many diseases. For this reason, fast and
accurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost
importance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their
diffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA
follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement
(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\propto t$). However, we show
that NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples,
i.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour
(MSD $\propto t^\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$). To support this observation we present
a range of experimental results for both polystyrene beads and EVs. This is
also related to another problem: for the same samples there exists a huge
discrepancy (by the factor of 2-4) between the sizes measured with NTA and with
the direct imaging methods, such as AFM. This can be remedied by e.g. the
Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is
limited in the biological and poly-disperse samples. On the other hand, the
models of sub-diffusion rarely provide the direct relation between the size of
a particle and the generalized diffusion constant. However, we solve this last
problem by introducing the logarithmic model of sub-diffusion, aimed at
retrieving the size data. In result, we propose a novel protocol of NTA data
analysis. The accuracy of our method is on par with FTLA for small
($\simeq$200nm) particles. We apply our method to study the EVs samples and
corroborate the results with AFM.

107,Primordial perturbations from inflation with a hyperbolic field-space,"  We study primordial perturbations from hyperinflation, proposed recently and
based on a hyperbolic field-space. In the previous work, it was shown that the
field-space angular momentum supported by the negative curvature modifies the
background dynamics and enhances fluctuations of the scalar fields
qualitatively, assuming that the inflationary background is almost de Sitter.
In this work, we confirm and extend the analysis based on the standard approach
of cosmological perturbation in multi-field inflation. At the background level,
to quantify the deviation from de Sitter, we introduce the slow-varying
parameters and show that steep potentials, which usually can not drive
inflation, can drive inflation. At the linear perturbation level, we obtain the
power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation and express the spectral
tilt and running in terms of the slow-varying parameters. We show that
hyperinflation with power-law type potentials has already been excluded by the
recent Planck observations, while exponential-type potential with the exponent
of order unity can be made consistent with observations as far as the power
spectrum is concerned. We also argue that, in the context of a simple $D$-brane
inflation, the hyperinflation requires exponentially large hyperbolic extra
dimensions but that masses of Kaluza-Klein gravitons can be kept relatively
heavy.

108,Role of Vanadyl Oxygen in Understanding Metallic Behavior of V2O5(001) Nanorods,"  Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), the most stable member of vanadium oxide family,
exhibits interesting semiconductor to metal transition in the temperature range
of 530-560 K. The metallic behavior originates because of the reduction of V2O5
through oxygen vacancies. In the present report, V2O5 nanorods in the
orthorhombic phase with crystal orientation of (001) are grown using vapor
transport process. Among three nonequivalent oxygen atoms in a VO5 pyramidal
formula unit in V2O5 structure, the role of terminal vanadyl oxygen (OI) in the
formation of metallic phase above the transition temperature is established
from the temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic studies. The origin of the
metallic behavior of V2O5 is also understood due to the breakdown of pdpi bond
between OI and nearest V atom instigated by the formation of vanadyl OI
vacancy, confirmed from the downward shift of the bottom most split-off
conduction bands in the material with increasing temperature.

ball which moreover has almost maximal volume, then in a smaller ball (in a
quantified sense) it holds an almost-euclidean isoperimetric inequality. The
result is actually established in the more general framework of non-smooth

110,Exponential Sums and Riesz energies,"  We bound an exponential sum that appears in the study of irregularities of
distribution (the low-frequency Fourier energy of the sum of several Dirac
measures) by geometric quantities: a special case is that for all $\left\{ x_1,
\dots, x_N\right\} \subset \mathbb{T}^2$, $X \geq 1$ and a universal $c>0$ $$
\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{ \frac{X^2}{1 + X^4 \|x_i -x_j\|^4}} \lesssim \sum_{k \in
\mathbb{Z}^2 \atop \|k\| \leq X}{ \left| \sum_{n=1}^{N}{ e^{2 \pi i
\left\langle k, x_n \right\rangle}}\right|^2} \lesssim \sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{ X^2
e^{-c X^2\|x_i -x_j\|^2}}.$$ Since this exponential sum is intimately tied to
rather subtle distribution properties of the points, we obtain nonlocal
structural statements for near-minimizers of the Riesz-type energy. In the
regime $X \gtrsim N^{1/2}$ both upper and lower bound match for
maximally-separated point sets satisfying $\|x_i -x_j\| \gtrsim N^{-1/2}$.

111,One dimensionalization in the spin-1 Heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice,"  We investigate the effect of dimensional crossover in the ground state of the
antiferromagnetic spin-$1$ Heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular
lattice that interpolates between the regime of weakly coupled Haldane chains
($J^{\prime}\! \!\ll\!\! J$) and the isotropic triangular lattice
($J^{\prime}\!\!=\!\!J$). We use the density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) and Schwinger boson theory performed at the Gaussian correction level
above the saddle-point solution. Our DMRG results show an abrupt transition
between decoupled spin chains and the spirally ordered regime at
$(J^{\prime}/J)_c\sim 0.42$, signaled by the sudden closing of the spin gap.
Coming from the magnetically ordered side, the computation of the spin
stiffness within Schwinger boson theory predicts the instability of the spiral
magnetic order toward a magnetically disordered phase with one-dimensional
features at $(J^{\prime}/J)_c \sim 0.43$. The agreement of these complementary
methods, along with the strong difference found between the intra- and the
interchain DMRG short spin-spin correlations; for sufficiently large values of
the interchain coupling, suggests that the interplay between the quantum
fluctuations and the dimensional crossover effects gives rise to the
one-dimensionalization phenomenon in this frustrated spin-$1$ Hamiltonian.

the uniform spectral convergence of the stochastic Galerkin method for the

114,Interlayer coupling and gate-tunable excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures,"  Bilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures such as MoS2/WS2 and MoSe2/WSe2
have attracted much attention recently, particularly because of their type II
band alignments and the formation of interlayer exciton as the lowest-energy
excitonic state. In this work, we calculate the electronic and optical
properties of such heterostructures with the first-principles GW+Bethe-Salpeter
Equation (BSE) method and reveal the important role of interlayer coupling in
deciding the excited-state properties, including the band alignment and
excitonic properties. Our calculation shows that due to the interlayer
coupling, the low energy excitons can be widely tunable by a vertical gate
field. In particular, the dipole oscillator strength and radiative lifetime of
the lowest energy exciton in these bilayer heterostructures is varied by over
an order of magnitude within a practical external gate field. We also build a
simple model that captures the essential physics behind this tunability and
allows the extension of the ab initio results to a large range of electric
fields. Our work clarifies the physical picture of interlayer excitons in
bilayer vdW heterostructures and predicts a wide range of gate-tunable
excited-state properties of 2D optoelectronic devices.

115,Enumeration of singular varieties with tangency conditions,"  We construct the algebraic cobordism theory of bundles and divisors on
varieties. It has a simple basis (over Q) from projective spaces and its rank
is equal to the number of Chern numbers. An application of this algebraic
cobordism theory is the enumeration of singular subvarieties with give tangent
conditions with a fixed smooth divisor, where the subvariety is the zero locus
of a section of a vector bundle. We prove that the generating series of numbers
of such subvarieties gives a homomorphism from the algebraic cobordism group to
the power series ring. This implies that the enumeration of singular
subvarieties with tangency conditions is governed by universal polynomials of
Chern numbers, when the vector bundle is sufficiently ample. This result
combines and generalizes the Caporaso-Harris recursive formula, Gottsche's
conjecture, classical De Jonquiere's Formula and node polynomials from tropical
geometry.

themselves by controlling robots that are comparable to the human body. Whether
this is possible without invasive interfaces has been unclear, due to the
robot's complexity and the person's limitations. We developed a novel,
augmented reality interface and conducted two studies to evaluate the extent to
which it enabled people with profound motor deficits to control robotic body
surrogates. 15 novice users achieved meaningful improvements on a clinical
manipulation assessment when controlling the robot in Atlanta from locations
across the United States. Also, one expert user performed 59 distinct tasks in
his own home over seven days, including self-care tasks such as feeding. Our
results demonstrate that people with profound motor deficits can effectively

117,ClusterNet: Detecting Small Objects in Large Scenes by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Information,"  Object detection in wide area motion imagery (WAMI) has drawn the attention
of the computer vision research community for a number of years. WAMI proposes
a number of unique challenges including extremely small object sizes, both
sparse and densely-packed objects, and extremely large search spaces (large
video frames). Nearly all state-of-the-art methods in WAMI object detection
report that appearance-based classifiers fail in this challenging data and
instead rely almost entirely on motion information in the form of background
subtraction or frame-differencing. In this work, we experimentally verify the
failure of appearance-based classifiers in WAMI, such as Faster R-CNN and a
heatmap-based fully convolutional neural network (CNN), and propose a novel
two-stage spatio-temporal CNN which effectively and efficiently combines both
appearance and motion information to significantly surpass the state-of-the-art
in WAMI object detection. To reduce the large search space, the first stage
(ClusterNet) takes in a set of extremely large video frames, combines the
motion and appearance information within the convolutional architecture, and
proposes regions of objects of interest (ROOBI). These ROOBI can contain from
one to clusters of several hundred objects due to the large video frame size
and varying object density in WAMI. The second stage (FoveaNet) then estimates
the centroid location of all objects in that given ROOBI simultaneously via
heatmap estimation. The proposed method exceeds state-of-the-art results on the
WPAFB 2009 dataset by 5-16% for moving objects and nearly 50% for stopped
objects, as well as being the first proposed method in wide area motion imagery
to detect completely stationary objects.

118,Fermi-edge singularity and the functional renormalization group,"  We study the Fermi-edge singularity, describing the response of a degenerate
electron system to optical excitation, in the framework of the functional
renormalization group (fRG). Results for the (interband) particle-hole
susceptibility from various implementations of fRG (one- and two-
particle-irreducible, multi-channel Hubbard-Stratonovich, flowing
susceptibility) are compared to the summation of all leading logarithmic (log)
diagrams, achieved by a (first-order) solution of the parquet equations. For
the (zero-dimensional) special case of the X-ray-edge singularity, we show that
the leading log formula can be analytically reproduced in a consistent way from
a truncated, one-loop fRG flow. However, reviewing the underlying diagrammatic
structure, we show that this derivation relies on fortuitous partial
cancellations special to the form of and accuracy applied to the X-ray-edge
singularity and does not generalize.

assumptions on the iterated function systems used, we show that the
quasi-Assouad dimension of self-similar random recursive sets is almost surely
equal to the almost sure Hausdorff dimension of the set. We further comment on
random homogeneous and $V$-variable sets and the removal of overlap conditions.

angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We combine this technique in
representative members of both the Fe-pnictides and Fe-chalcogenides with ab
initio density functional theory and tight-binding calculations to establish an
ubiquitous modification of the electronic structure in these materials imbued
by SOC. The influence of SOC is found to be concentrated on the hole pockets
where the superconducting gap is generally found to be largest. This result
contests descriptions of superconductivity in these materials in terms of pure
spin-singlet eigenstates, raising questions regarding the possible pairing
mechanisms and role of SOC therein.

mean-variance portfolio optimization problems. Starting from real financial
data statistics and following the principles of the Modern Portfolio Theory, we
generate parametrized samples of portfolio optimization problems that can be
related to quadratic binary optimization forms programmable in the analog
D-Wave Quantum Annealer 2000Q. The instances are also solvable by an
industry-established Genetic Algorithm approach, which we use as a classical
benchmark. We investigate several options to run the quantum computation
optimally, ultimately discovering that the best results in terms of expected
time-to-solution as a function of number of variables for the hardest instances
set are obtained by seeding the quantum annealer with a solution candidate
found by a greedy local search and then performing a reverse annealing
protocol. The optimized reverse annealing protocol is found to be more than 100

125,Robust XVA,"  We introduce an arbitrage-free framework for robust valuation adjustments. An
investor trades a credit default swap portfolio with a risky counterparty, and
hedges credit risk by taking a position in the counterparty bond. The investor
does not know the expected rate of return of the counterparty bond, but he is
confident that it lies within an uncertainty interval. We derive both upper and
lower bounds for the XVA process of the portfolio, and show that these bounds
may be recovered as solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The
presence of collateralization and closeout payoffs leads to fundamental
differences with respect to classical credit risk valuation. The value of the
super-replicating portfolio cannot be directly obtained by plugging one of the
extremes of the uncertainty interval in the valuation equation, but rather
depends on the relation between the XVA replicating portfolio and the close-out
value throughout the life of the transaction.

whereas positive shocks to the BitCoin stock, interest rate and the size of the

127,Mean-Field Games with Differing Beliefs for Algorithmic Trading,"  Even when confronted with the same data, agents often disagree on a model of
the real-world. Here, we address the question of how interacting heterogenous
agents, who disagree on what model the real-world follows, optimize their
trading actions. The market has latent factors that drive prices, and agents
account for the permanent impact they have on prices. This leads to a large
stochastic game, where each agents' performance criteria is computed under a
different probability measure. We analyse the mean-field game (MFG) limit of
the stochastic game and show that the Nash equilibria is given by the solution
to a non-standard vector-valued forward-backward stochastic differential
equation. Under some mild assumptions, we construct the solution in terms of
expectations of the filtered states. We prove the MFG strategy forms an
\epsilon-Nash equilibrium for the finite player game. Lastly, we present a
least-squares Monte Carlo based algorithm for computing the optimal control and
illustrate the results through simulation in market where agents disagree on

agent optimally builds her portfolio by investing in a bond and a risky asset.
The asset price dynamics follow a diffusion process with regime-switching
coefficients modeled by a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. We
consider an investor with a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility
function. We deduce the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to
construct the solution and the optimal trading strategy and verify optimality
by showing that the value function is the unique constrained viscosity solution
of the HJB equation. By means of a Laplace transform method, we show how to
explicitly compute the value function and illustrate the method with the two-
and three-states cases. This method is interesting in its own right and can be
adapted in other applications involving hybrid systems and using other types of
transforms with basic properties similar to the Laplace transform.

130,Portfolio diversification and model uncertainty: a robust dynamic mean-variance approach,"  This paper is concerned with a multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection
problem under model uncertainty. We develop a continuous time framework for
taking into account ambiguity aversion about both expected return rates and
correlation matrix of the assets, and for studying the effects on portfolio
diversification. We prove a separation principle for the associated robust
control problem, which allows to reduce the determination of the optimal
dynamic strategy to the parametric computation of the minimal risk premium
function. Our results provide a justification for under-diversification, as
documented in empirical studies. We explicitly quantify the degree of
under-diversification in terms of correlation and Sharpe ratio ambiguity. In
particular, we show that an investor with a poor confidence in the expected
return estimation does not hold any risky asset, and on the other hand, trades
only one risky asset when the level of ambiguity on correlation matrix is
large. This extends to the continuous-time setting the results obtained by
Garlappi, Uppal and Wang [13], and Liu and Zeng [24] in a one-period model. JEL

bi-demographic structure on the current account and growth. By using a SVAR
modeling, we track the dynamic impacts between the underlying variables of the
Saudi economy. New insights have been developed to study the interrelations
between population growth, current account and economic growth inside the
neoclassical theory of population. The long-run net impact on economic growth
of the bi-population growth is negative, due to the typically lower skill sets
of the immigrant labor population. Besides, the negative long-run contribution
of immigrant workers to the current account growth largely exceeds that of
contributions from the native population, because of the increasing levels of
remittance outflows from the country. We find that a positive shock in
immigration leads to a negative impact on native active age ratio. Thus, the
immigrants appear to be more substitutes than complements for native workers.

134,Temporal Logistic Neural Bag-of-Features for Financial Time series Forecasting leveraging Limit Order Book Data,"  Time series forecasting is a crucial component of many important
applications, ranging from forecasting the stock markets to energy load
prediction. The high-dimensionality, velocity and variety of the data collected
in these applications pose significant and unique challenges that must be
carefully addressed for each of them. In this work, a novel Temporal Logistic
Neural Bag-of-Features approach, that can be used to tackle these challenges,
is proposed. The proposed method can be effectively combined with deep neural
networks, leading to powerful deep learning models for time series analysis.
However, combining existing BoF formulations with deep feature extractors pose
significant challenges: the distribution of the input features is not
stationary, tuning the hyper-parameters of the model can be especially
difficult and the normalizations involved in the BoF model can cause
significant instabilities during the training process. The proposed method is
capable of overcoming these limitations by a employing a novel adaptive scaling
mechanism and replacing the classical Gaussian-based density estimation
involved in the regular BoF model with a logistic kernel. The effectiveness of
the proposed approach is demonstrated using extensive experiments on a
large-scale financial time series dataset that consists of more than 4 million
limit orders.

entrepreneurship is more pronounced in low-quality institutional contexts and
less pronounced in high-quality institutional contexts. Using data from the
Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and regulation data from the economic
freedom of the world index (EFW), we test our predictions and find evidence in

entrepreneurship, these disparities are reduced as the quality of the

136,Ranking Causal Influence of Financial Markets via Directed Information Graphs,"  A non-parametric method for ranking stock indices according to their mutual
causal influences is presented. Under the assumption that indices reflect the
underlying economy of a country, such a ranking indicates which countries exert
the most economic influence in an examined subset of the global economy. The
proposed method represents the indices as nodes in a directed graph, where the
edges' weights are estimates of the pair-wise causal influences, quantified
using the directed information functional. This method facilitates using a
relatively small number of samples from each index. The indices are then ranked
according to their net-flow in the estimated graph (sum of the incoming weights
subtracted from the sum of outgoing weights). Daily and minute-by-minute data
from nine indices (three from Asia, three from Europe and three from the US)
were analyzed. The analysis of daily data indicates that the US indices are the
most influential, which is consistent with intuition that the indices
representing larger economies usually exert more influence. Yet, it is also
shown that an index representing a small economy can strongly influence an
index representing a large economy if the smaller economy is indicative of a
larger phenomenon. Finally, it is shown that while inter-region interactions
can be captured using daily data, intra-region interactions require more
frequent samples.

optimization methods are twofold. In what we call an Stochastic Differential
Equation approach, we compute the optimal weights using mean-variance criterion
and power utility maximization. We show that dynamically switching between
these two optimal strategies by introducing a triggering function can further
improve the portfolio returns. We contrast this with the machine learning
clustering methodology inspired by the band-wise Gaussian mixture model. The
first benefit of the machine learning over the Stochastic Differential Equation
approach is that we were able to achieve the same results though a simpler

138,Once in a blue moon: detection of 'bluing' during debris transits in the white dwarf WD1145+017,"  The first transiting planetesimal orbiting a white dwarf was recently
detected in K2 data of WD1145+017 and has been followed up intensively. The
multiple, long, and variable transits suggest the transiting objects are dust
clouds, probably produced by a disintegrating asteroid. In addition, the system
contains circumstellar gas, evident by broad absorption lines, mostly in the
u'-band, and a dust disc, indicated by an infrared excess. Here we present the
first detection of a change in colour of WD1145+017 during transits, using
simultaneous multi-band fast-photometry ULTRACAM measurements over the
u'g'r'i'-bands. The observations reveal what appears to be 'bluing' during
transits; transits are deeper in the redder bands, with a u'-r' colour
difference of up to ~-0.05 mag. We explore various possible explanations for
the bluing. 'Spectral' photometry obtained by integrating over bandpasses in
the spectroscopic data in- and out-of-transit, compared to the photometric
data, shows that the observed colour difference is most likely the result of
reduced circumstellar absorption in the spectrum during transits. This
indicates that the transiting objects and the gas share the same line-of-sight,
and that the gas covers the white dwarf only partially, as would be expected if
the gas, the transiting debris, and the dust emitting the infrared excess, are
part of the same general disc structure (although possibly at different radii).
In addition, we present the results of a week-long monitoring campaign of the
system.

139,"Viscous dynamics of drops and bubbles in Hele-Shaw cells: drainage, drag friction, coalescence, and bursting","  In this review article, we discuss recent studies on drops and bubbles in
Hele-Shaw cells, focusing on how scaling laws exhibit crossovers from the
three-dimensional counterparts and focusing on topics in which viscosity plays
an important role. By virtue of progresses in analytical theory and high-speed
imaging, dynamics of drops and bubbles have actively been studied with the aid
of scaling arguments. However, compared with three dimensional problems,
studies on the corresponding problems in Hele-Shaw cells are still limited.
This review demonstrates that the effect of confinement in the Hele-Shaw cell
introduces new physics allowing different scaling regimes to appear. For this
purpose, we discuss various examples that are potentially important for
industrial applications handling drops and bubbles in confined spaces by
showing agreement between experiments and scaling theories. As a result, this
review provides a collection of problems in hydrodynamics that may be
analytically solved or that may be worth studying numerically in the near
future.

140,Stacking-based Deep Neural Network: Deep Analytic Network on Convolutional Spectral Histogram Features,"  Stacking-based deep neural network (S-DNN), in general, denotes a deep neural
network (DNN) resemblance in terms of its very deep, feedforward network
architecture. The typical S-DNN aggregates a variable number of individually
learnable modules in series to assemble a DNN-alike alternative to the targeted
object recognition tasks. This work likewise devises an S-DNN instantiation,
dubbed deep analytic network (DAN), on top of the spectral histogram (SH)
features. The DAN learning principle relies on ridge regression, and some key
DNN constituents, specifically, rectified linear unit, fine-tuning, and
normalization. The DAN aptitude is scrutinized on three repositories of varying
domains, including FERET (faces), MNIST (handwritten digits), and CIFAR10
(natural objects). The empirical results unveil that DAN escalates the SH
baseline performance over a sufficiently deep layer.

141,Superconductivity and Frozen Electronic States at the (111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interface,"  In spite of Anderson's theorem, disorder is known to affect superconductivity
in conventional s-wave superconductors. In most superconductors, the degree of
disorder is fixed during sample preparation. Here we report measurements of the
superconducting properties of the two-dimensional gas that forms at the
interface between LaAlO$_3$ (LAO) and SrTiO$_3$ (STO) in the (111) crystal
orientation, a system that permits \emph{in situ} tuning of carrier density and
disorder by means of a back gate voltage $V_g$. Like the (001) oriented LAO/STO
interface, superconductivity at the (111) LAO/STO interface can be tuned by
$V_g$. In contrast to the (001) interface, superconductivity in these (111)
samples is anisotropic, being different along different interface crystal
directions, consistent with the strong anisotropy already observed other
transport properties at the (111) LAO/STO interface. In addition, we find that
the (111) interface samples ""remember"" the backgate voltage $V_F$ at which they
are cooled at temperatures near the superconducting transition temperature
$T_c$, even if $V_g$ is subsequently changed at lower temperatures. The low
energy scale and other characteristics of this memory effect ($<1$ K)
distinguish it from charge-trapping effects previously observed in (001)
interface samples.

short proton beam. The structure of the studied wakefields are similar to those
of a long, modulated proton beam, such as the AWAKE proton driver. We show that
by properly choosing the electron beam parameters and exploiting two well known
effects, beam loading of the wakefield and full blow out of plasma electrons by
the accelerated beam, the electron beam can gain large amounts of energy with a
narrow final energy spread (%-level) and without significant emittance growth.

subjected to a strong memoryless nonlinearity. The receiver design is based on
a generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) framework, and this allows
real-time algorithm implementation in software or hardware with moderate
complexity. We demonstrate that the proposed receiver can provide more than a
2dB gain compared with an ideal uncoded linear OFDM transmission at a BER range
$10^{-4}\div10^{-6}$ in the AWGN channel, when the OFDM signal is subjected to
clipping nonlinearity and the crest-factor of the clipped waveform is only
1.9dB. Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed receiver provides
significant performance gain in frequency-selective multipath channels

144,Nonlinear fractal meaning of the Hubble constant,"  According to astrophysical observations value of recession velocity in a
certain point is proportional to a distance to this point. The proportionality
coefficient is the Hubble constant measured with 5% accuracy. It is used in
many cosmological theories describing dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and
their relation with the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein.
In the present work we have determined a limit value of the global Hubble
constant (in a big distance from a point of observations) theoretically without
using any empirical constants on the base of our own fractal model used for the
description a relation between distance to an observed galaxy and coordinate of
its center. The distance has been defined as a nonlinear fractal measure with
scale of measurement corresponding to a deviation of the measure from its fixed
value (zero-gravity radius). We have suggested a model of specific anisotropic
fractal for simulation a radial Universe expansion. Our theoretical results
have shown existence of an inverse proportionality between accuracy of
determination the Hubble constant and accuracy of calculation a coordinates of
galaxies leading to ambiguity results obtained at cosmological observations.

145,SEA: String Executability Analysis by Abstract Interpretation,"  Dynamic languages often employ reflection primitives to turn dynamically
generated text into executable code at run-time. These features make standard
static analysis extremely hard if not impossible because its essential data
structures, i.e., the control-flow graph and the system of recursive equations
associated with the program to analyse, are themselves dynamically mutating
objects. We introduce SEA, an abstract interpreter for automatic sound string
executability analysis of dynamic languages employing bounded (i.e, finitely
nested) reflection and dynamic code generation. Strings are statically
approximated in an abstract domain of finite state automata with basic
operations implemented as symbolic transducers. SEA combines standard program
analysis together with string executability analysis. The analysis of a call to
reflection determines a call to the same abstract interpreter over a code which
is synthesised directly from the result of the static string executability
analysis at that program point. The use of regular languages for approximating
dynamically generated code structures allows SEA to soundly approximate safety
properties of self modifying programs yet maintaining efficiency. Soundness
here means that the semantics of the code synthesised by the analyser to
resolve reflection over-approximates the semantics of the code dynamically
built at run-rime by the program at that point.

146,On the trade-off between labels and weights in quantitative bisimulation,"  Reductions for transition systems have been recently introduced as a uniform
and principled method for comparing the expressiveness of system models with
respect to a range of properties, especially bisimulations. In this paper we
study the expressiveness (w.r.t. bisimulations) of models for quantitative
computations such as weighted labelled transition systems (WLTSs), uniform
labelled transition systems (ULTraSs), and state-to-function transition systems
(FuTSs). We prove that there is a trade-off between labels and weights: at one
extreme lays the class of (unlabelled) weighted transition systems where
information is presented using weights only; at the other lays the class of
labelled transition systems (LTSs) where information is shifted on labels.
These categories of systems cannot be further reduced in any significant way
and subsume all the aforementioned models.

147,Poynting's theorem in magnetic turbulence,"  Poynting's theorem is used to obtain an expression for the turbulent
power-spectral density as function of frequency and wavenumber in low-frequency
magnetic turbulence. No reference is made to Elsasser variables as is usually
done in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence mixing mechanical and electromagnetic
turbulence. We rather stay with an implicit form of the mechanical part of
turbulence as suggested by electromagnetic theory in arbitrary media. All of
mechanics and flows is included into a turbulent response function which by
appropriate observations can be determined from knowledge of the turbulent
fluctuation spectra. This approach is not guided by the wish of developing a
complete theory of turbulence. It aims on the identification of the response
function from observations as input into a theory which afterwards attempts its
interpretation. Combination of both the magnetic and electric power spectral
densities leads to a representation of the turbulent response function, i.e.
the turbulent conductivity spectrum $\sigma_{\omega k}$ as function of
frequency $\omega$ and wavenumber $k$. {It is given as the ratio of magnetic to
electric power spectral densities in frequency space. This knowledge allows for
formally writing down a turbulent dispersion relation. Power law inertial range
spectra result in a power law turbulent conductivity spectrum. These can be
compared with observations in the solar wind. Keywords: MHD turbulence,

148,Polar factorization of conformal and projective maps of the sphere in the sense of optimal mass transport,"  Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold and let $\mu$,d be the associated
measure and distance on M. Robert McCann obtained, generalizing results for the
Euclidean case by Yann Brenier, the polar factorization of Borel maps S : M ->
M pushing forward $\mu$ to a measure $\nu$: each S factors uniquely a.e. into
the composition S = T \circ U, where U : M -> M is volume preserving and T : M
-> M is the optimal map transporting $\mu$ to $\nu$ with respect to the cost
function d^2/2.
In this article we study the polar factorization of conformal and projective
maps of the sphere S^n. For conformal maps, which may be identified with
elements of the identity component of O(1,n+1), we prove that the polar
factorization in the sense of optimal mass transport coincides with the
algebraic polar factorization (Cartan decomposition) of this Lie group. For the
projective case, where the group GL_+(n+1) is involved, we find necessary and
sufficient conditions for these two factorizations to agree.

mixed-effects models each have their advantages and disadvantages, making it
difficult for practitioners to determine how to carry out a spatial regression
analysis. We discuss the data-generating mechanisms implicitly assumed by
various popular spatial regression models, and discuss the implications of
these assumptions. We propose Bayesian spatial filtering as an approximate
middle way between non-spatial models and traditional spatial mixed models. We
show by simulation that our Bayesian spatial filtering model has several
desirable properties and hence may be a useful addition to a spatial

151,Behaviour of electron content in the ionospheric D-region during solar X-ray flares,"  One of the most important parameters in ionospheric plasma research also
having a wide practical application in wireless satellite telecommunications is
the total electron content (TEC) representing the columnal electron number
density. The F region with high electron density provides the biggest
contribution to TEC while the relatively weakly ionized plasma of the D region
(60 km - 90 km above Earths surface) is often considered as a negligible cause
of satellite signal disturbances. However, sudden intensive ionization
processes like those induced by solar X ray flares can cause relative increases
of electron density that are significantly larger in the D-region than in
regions at higher altitudes. Therefore, one cannot exclude a priori the D
region from investigations of ionospheric influences on propagation of
electromagnetic signals emitted by satellites. We discuss here this problem
which has not been sufficiently treated in literature so far. The obtained
results are based on data collected from the D region monitoring by very low
frequency radio waves and on vertical TEC calculations from the Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal analyses, and they show noticeable
variations in the D region electron content (TECD) during activity of a solar X
ray flare (it rises by a factor of 136 in the considered case) when TECD
contribution to TEC can reach several percent and which cannot be neglected in
practical applications like global positioning procedures by satellites.

152,Zero-point spin-fluctuations of single adatoms,"  Stabilizing the magnetic signal of single adatoms is a crucial step towards
their successful usage in widespread technological applications such as
high-density magnetic data storage devices. The quantum mechanical nature of
these tiny objects, however, introduces intrinsic zero-point spin-fluctuations
that tend to destabilize the local magnetic moment of interest by dwindling the
magnetic anisotropy potential barrier even at absolute zero temperature. Here,
we elucidate the origins and quantify the effect of the fundamental ingredients
determining the magnitude of the fluctuations, namely the ($i$) local magnetic
moment, ($ii$) spin-orbit coupling and ($iii$) electron-hole Stoner
excitations. Based on a systematic first-principles study of 3d and 4d adatoms,
we demonstrate that the transverse contribution of the fluctuations is
comparable in size to the magnetic moment itself, leading to a remarkable
$\gtrsim$50$\%$ reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy. Our analysis gives
rise to a comprehensible diagram relating the fluctuation magnitude to
characteristic features of adatoms, providing practical guidelines for
designing magnetically stable nanomagnets with minimal quantum fluctuations.

153,Exploration-exploitation tradeoffs dictate the optimal distributions of phenotypes for populations subject to fitness fluctuations,"  We study a minimal model for the growth of a phenotypically heterogeneous
population of cells subject to a fluctuating environment in which they can
replicate (by exploiting available resources) and modify their phenotype within
a given landscape (thereby exploring novel configurations). The model displays
an exploration-exploitation trade-off whose specifics depend on the statistics
of the environment. Most notably, the phenotypic distribution corresponding to
maximum population fitness (i.e. growth rate) requires a non-zero exploration
rate when the magnitude of environmental fluctuations changes randomly over
time, while a purely exploitative strategy turns out to be optimal in two-state
environments, independently of the statistics of switching times. We obtain
analytical insight into the limiting cases of very fast and very slow
exploration rates by directly linking population growth to the features of the
environment.

155,Optimizing Mission Critical Data Dissemination in Massive IoT Networks,"  Mission critical data dissemination in massive Internet of things (IoT)
networks imposes constraints on the message transfer delay between devices. Due
to low power and communication range of IoT devices, data is foreseen to be
relayed over multiple device-to-device (D2D) links before reaching the
destination. The coexistence of a massive number of IoT devices poses a
challenge in maximizing the successful transmission capacity of the overall
network alongside reducing the multi-hop transmission delay in order to support
mission critical applications. There is a delicate interplay between the
carrier sensing threshold of the contention based medium access protocol and
the choice of packet forwarding strategy selected at each hop by the devices.
The fundamental problem in optimizing the performance of such networks is to
balance the tradeoff between conflicting performance objectives such as the
spatial frequency reuse, transmission quality, and packet progress towards the
destination. In this paper, we use a stochastic geometry approach to quantify
the performance of multi-hop massive IoT networks in terms of the spatial
frequency reuse and the transmission quality under different packet forwarding
schemes. We also develop a comprehensive performance metric that can be used to
optimize the system to achieve the best performance. The results can be used to
select the best forwarding scheme and tune the carrier sensing threshold to
optimize the performance of the network according to the delay constraints and
transmission quality requirements.

156,Interference of two co-directional exclusion processes in the presence of a static bottleneck: a biologically motivated model,"  We develope a two-species exclusion process with a distinct pair of entry and
exit sites for each species of rigid rods. The relatively slower forward
stepping of the rods in an extended bottleneck region, located in between the
two entry sites, controls the extent of interference of the co-directional flow
of the two species of rods. The relative positions of the sites of entry of the
two species of rods with respect to the location of the bottleneck are
motivated by a biological phenomenon. However, the primary focus of the study
here is to explore the effects of the interference of the flow of the two
species of rods on their spatio-temporal organization and the regulations of
this interference by the extended bottleneck. By a combination of mean-field
theory and computer simulation we calculate the flux of both species of rods
and their density profiles as well as the composite phase diagrams of the
system. If the bottleneck is sufficiently stringent some of the phases become
practically unrealizable although not ruled out on the basis of any fundamental
physical principle. Moreover the extent of suppression of flow of the
downstream entrants by the flow of the upstream entrants can also be regulated
by the strength of the bottleneck. We speculate on the possible implications of
the results in the context of the biological phenomenon that motivated the
formulation of the theoretical model.

upper critical behavior (for short and long range $\phi^n$-theories) and below
it. This allows us to check the scaling relations among these critical
exponents obtained by analysing the complex singularities (Lee-Yang and Fisher
zeroes) of these models. Moreover, we have obtained an explicit method to
compute the $\hat{\coppa}$ exponent [defined by $\xi\sim L (\log

topic of theoretical and experimental investigation and yet it lacks a truly

processes to the fundamental temperature scales of Kondo screening and
Fermi-liquid lattice coherence. Here, the temperature-dependence of $f$-$d$
hybridized band dispersions and Fermi-energy $f$ spectral weight in the Kondo
lattice system CeCoIn$_5$ is investigated using $f$-resonant angle-resolved
photoemission (ARPES) with sufficient detail to allow direct comparison to
first principles dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations containing
full realism of crystalline electric field states. The ARPES results, for two
orthogonal (001) and (100) cleaved surfaces and three different $f$-$d$
hybridization scenarios, with additional microscopic insight provided by DMFT,
reveal $f$ participation in the Fermi surface at temperatures much higher than
the lattice coherence temperature, $T^*\approx$ 45 K, commonly believed to be
the onset for such behavior. The identification of a $T$-dependent crystalline
electric field degeneracy crossover in the DMFT theory $below$ $T^*$ is

do not rely on the fact that it suffices to study when $n<n_0$ and thus our

162,Not even wrong: The spurious link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning,"  Resolving the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has
been one of the central goals of modern ecology. Early debates about the
relationship were finally resolved with the advent of a statistical
partitioning scheme that decomposed the biodiversity effect into a ""selection""
effect and a ""complementarity"" effect. We prove that both the biodiversity
effect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are
fundamentally flawed because these methods use a naÃƒÂ¯ve null expectation based
on neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity
effect, and they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem
functioning relationships observed in nature. Furthermore, under such
nonlinearity no statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity
effects. We also present an alternative metric providing a more reasonable
estimate of biodiversity effect. Our results suggest that all studies conducted
since the early 1990s likely overestimated the positive effects of biodiversity
on ecosystem functioning.

The next generation of AI systems promises to accelerate these developments

individuals without compromising confidentiality. These challenges will be
exacerbated by the end of the Moore's Law, which will constrain the amount of

several open research directions in systems, architectures, and security that
can address these challenges and help unlock AI's potential to improve lives

how to construct G-spectra from G-spaces with suitable structure. There is a
naive version which gives naive G-spectra for any topological group G, but our
focus is on the construction of genuine G-spectra when G is finite.
We give new information about the Segal and operadic equivariant infinite

equivalent output when fed equivalent input. The proof of the corresponding
nonequivariant uniqueness theorem, due to May and Thomason, works for naive
G-spectra for general G but fails hopelessly for genuine G-spectra when G is
finite. Even in the nonequivariant case, our comparison theorem is considerably

168,On the apparent permeability of porous media in rarefied gas flows,"  The apparent gas permeability of the porous medium is an important parameter
in the prediction of unconventional gas production, which was first
investigated systematically by Klinkenberg in 1941 and found to increase with
the reciprocal mean gas pressure (or equivalently, the Knudsen number).
Although the underlying rarefaction effects are well-known, the reason that the
correction factor in Klinkenberg's famous equation decreases when the Knudsen
number increases has not been fully understood. Most of the studies idealize
the porous medium as a bundle of straight cylindrical tubes, however, according
to the gas kinetic theory, this only results in an increase of the correction
factor with the Knudsen number, which clearly contradicts Klinkenberg's
experimental observations. Here, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation
in simplified (but not simple) porous media, we identify, for the first time,
two key factors that can explain Klinkenberg's experimental results: the
tortuous flow path and the non-unitary tangential momentum accommodation
coefficient for the gas-surface interaction. Moreover, we find that
Klinkenberg's results can only be observed when the ratio between the apparent
and intrinsic permeabilities is $\lesssim30$; at large ratios (or Knudsen
numbers) the correction factor increases with the Knudsen number. Our numerical
results could also serve as benchmarking cases to assess the accuracy of
macroscopic models and/or numerical schemes for the modeling/simulation of
rarefied gas flows in complex geometries over a wide range of gas rarefaction.

result to arbitrary graphs and prove that the number of copies of a strictly

170,Increasing the Reusability of Enforcers with Lifecycle Events,"  Runtime enforcement can be effectively used to improve the reliability of
software applications. However, it often requires the definition of ad hoc
policies and enforcement strategies, which might be expensive to identify and
implement. This paper discusses how to exploit lifecycle events to obtain
useful enforcement strategies that can be easily reused across applications,
thus reducing the cost of adoption of the runtime enforcement technology. The
paper finally sketches how this idea can be used to define libraries that can
automatically overcome problems related to applications misusing them.

171,A Fast Interior Point Method for Atomic Norm Soft Thresholding,"  The atomic norm provides a generalization of the $\ell_1$-norm to continuous
parameter spaces. When applied as a sparse regularizer for line spectral
estimation the solution can be obtained by solving a convex optimization
problem. This problem is known as atomic norm soft thresholding (AST). It can
be cast as a semidefinite program and solved by standard methods. In the
semidefinite formulation there are $O(N^2)$ dual variables and a standard
primal-dual interior point method requires at least $O(N^6)$ flops per
iteration. That has lead researcher to consider alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) for the solution of AST, but this method is still somewhat
slow for large problem sizes. To obtain a faster algorithm we reformulate AST
as a non-symmetric conic program. That has two properties of key importance to
its numerical solution: the conic formulation has only $O(N)$ dual variables
and the Toeplitz structure inherent to AST is preserved. Based on it we derive
FastAST which is a primal-dual interior point method for solving AST. Two
variants are considered with the fastest one requiring only $O(N^2)$ flops per
iteration. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that FastAST solves AST
significantly faster than a state-of-the-art solver based on ADMM.

172,Economically Efficient Combined Plant and Controller Design Using Batch Bayesian Optimization: Mathematical Framework and Airborne Wind Energy Case Study,"  We present a novel data-driven nested optimization framework that addresses
the problem of coupling between plant and controller optimization. This
optimization strategy is tailored towards instances where a closed-form
expression for the system dynamic response is unobtainable and simulations or
experiments are necessary. Specifically, Bayesian Optimization, which is a
data-driven technique for finding the optimum of an unknown and
expensive-to-evaluate objective function, is employed to solve a nested
optimization problem. The underlying objective function is modeled by a
Gaussian Process (GP); then, Bayesian Optimization utilizes the predictive
uncertainty information from the GP to determine the best subsequent control or
plant parameters. The proposed framework differs from the majority of co-design
literature where there exists a closed-form model of the system dynamics.
Furthermore, we utilize the idea of Batch Bayesian Optimization at the plant
optimization level to generate a set of plant designs at each iteration of the
overall optimization process, recognizing that there will exist economies of
scale in running multiple experiments in each iteration of the plant design
process. We validate the proposed framework for a Buoyant Airborne Turbine
(BAT). We choose the horizontal stabilizer area, longitudinal center of mass
relative to center of buoyancy (plant parameters), and the pitch angle
set-point (controller parameter) as our decision variables. Our results
demonstrate that these plant and control parameters converge to their
respective optimal values within only a few iterations.

173,The 10 phases of spin chains with two Ising symmetries,"  We explore the topological properties of quantum spin-1/2 chains with two
Ising symmetries. This class of models does not possess any of the symmetries
that are required to protect the Haldane phase. Nevertheless, we show that
there are 4 symmetry-protected topological phases, in addition to 6 phases that
spontaneously break one or both Ising symmetries. By mapping the model to
one-dimensional interacting fermions with particle-hole and time-reversal
symmetry, we obtain integrable parent Hamiltonians for the conventional and
topological phases of the spin model. We use these Hamiltonians to characterize
the physical properties of all 10 phases, identify their local and nonlocal
order parameters, and understand the effects of weak perturbations that respect
the Ising symmetries. Our study provides the first explicit example of a class
of spin chains with several topologically non-trivial phases, and binds
together the topological classifications of interacting bosons and fermions.

174,Generalized subspace subcodes with application in cryptology,"  Most of the codes that have an algebraic decoding algorithm are derived from
the Reed Solomon codes. They are obtained by taking equivalent codes, for
example the generalized Reed Solomon codes, or by using the so-called subfield
subcode method, which leads to Alternant codes and Goppa codes over the
underlying prime field, or over some intermediate subfield. The main advantages
of these constructions is to preserve both the minimum distance and the
decoding algorithm of the underlying Reed Solomon code. In this paper, we
propose a generalization of the subfield subcode construction by introducing
the notion of subspace subcodes and a generalization of the equivalence of
codes which leads to the notion of generalized subspace subcodes. When the
dimension of the selected subspaces is equal to one, we show that our approach
gives exactly the family of the codes obtained by equivalence and subfield
subcode technique. However, our approach highlights the links between the
subfield subcode of a code defined over an extension field and the operation of
puncturing the $q$-ary image of this code. When the dimension of the subspaces
is greater than one, we obtain codes whose alphabet is no longer a finite
field, but a set of r-uples. We explain why these codes are practically as
efficient for applications as the codes defined on an extension of degree r. In
addition, they make it possible to obtain decodable codes over a large alphabet
having parameters previously inaccessible. As an application, we give some
examples that can be used in public key cryptosystems such as McEliece.

175,Lagrangian fibers of Gelfand-Cetlin systems,"  Motivated by the study of Nishinou-Nohara-Ueda on the Floer thoery of
Gelfand-Cetlin systems over complex partial flag manifolds, we provide a
complete description of the topology of Gelfand-Cetlin fibers. We prove that
all fibers are \emph{smooth} isotropic submanifolds and give a complete
description of the fiber to be Lagrangian in terms of combinatorics of
Gelfand-Cetlin polytope. Then we study (non-)displaceability of Lagrangian
fibers. After a few combinatorial and numercal tests for the displaceability,
using the bulk-deformation of Floer cohomology by Schubert cycles, we prove
that every full flag manifold $\mathcal{F}(n)$ ($n \geq 3$) with a monotone
Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form carries a continuum of
non-displaceable Lagrangian tori which degenerates to a non-torus fiber in the
Hausdorff limit. In particular, the Lagrangian $S^3$-fiber in $\mathcal{F}(3)$
is non-displaceable the question of which was raised by Nohara-Ueda who
computed its Floer cohomology to be vanishing.

176,Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis with A New Tensor Nuclear Norm,"  In this paper, we consider the Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis
(TRPCA) problem, which aims to exactly recover the low-rank and sparse
components from their sum. Our model is based on the recently proposed
tensor-tensor product (or t-product) [13]. Induced by the t-product, we first
rigorously deduce the tensor spectral norm, tensor nuclear norm, and tensor
average rank, and show that the tensor nuclear norm is the convex envelope of
the tensor average rank within the unit ball of the tensor spectral norm. These
definitions, their relationships and properties are consistent with matrix
cases. Equipped with the new tensor nuclear norm, we then solve the TRPCA
problem by solving a convex program and provide the theoretical guarantee for
the exact recovery. Our TRPCA model and recovery guarantee include matrix RPCA
as a special case. Numerical experiments verify our results, and the
applications to image recovery and background modeling problems demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

177,Resolving the age bimodality of galaxy stellar populations on kpc scales,"  Galaxies in the local Universe are known to follow bimodal distributions in
the global stellar populations properties. We analyze the distribution of the
local average stellar-population ages of 654,053 sub-galactic regions resolved
on ~1-kpc scales in a volume-corrected sample of 394 galaxies, drawn from the
CALIFA-DR3 integral-field-spectroscopy survey and complemented by SDSS imaging.
We find a bimodal local-age distribution, with an old and a young peak
primarily due to regions in early-type galaxies and star-forming regions of
spirals, respectively. Within spiral galaxies, the older ages of bulges and
inter-arm regions relative to spiral arms support an internal age bimodality.
Although regions of higher stellar-mass surface-density, mu*, are typically
older, mu* alone does not determine the stellar population age and a bimodal
distribution is found at any fixed mu*. We identify an ""old ridge"" of regions
of age ~9 Gyr, independent of mu*, and a ""young sequence"" of regions with age
increasing with mu* from 1-1.5 Gyr to 4-5 Gyr. We interpret the former as
regions containing only old stars, and the latter as regions where the relative
contamination of old stellar populations by young stars decreases as mu*
increases. The reason why this bimodal age distribution is not inconsistent
with the unimodal shape of the cosmic-averaged star-formation history is that
i) the dominating contribution by young stars biases the age low with respect
to the average epoch of star formation, and ii) the use of a single average age
per region is unable to represent the full time-extent of the star-formation
history of ""young-sequence"" regions.

protein-interaction networks using a sequence-based mutational algorithm, and
apply the model to study neutral drift in networks that yield oscillatory
dynamics. Starting with a functional core module, random evolutionary drift
increases network complexity even in the absence of specific selective
pressures. Surprisingly, we uncover a hidden order in sequence space that gives
rise to long-term evolutionary memory, implying strong constraints on network
evolution due to the topology of accessible sequence space.

we proposed an end-to-end system for handwritten string recognition. Compared
with the conventional methods, there is no preprocess nor manually designed

method to different applications. Although the performance of the proposed
method may not be comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches, it's

181,Mathematics of Isogeny Based Cryptography,"  These lectures notes were written for a summer school on Mathematics for
post-quantum cryptography in ThiÃƒÂ¨s, Senegal. They try to provide a guide for
Masters' students to get through the vast literature on elliptic curves,
without getting lost on their way to learning isogeny based cryptography. They
are by no means a reference text on the theory of elliptic curves, nor on
cryptography; students are encouraged to complement these notes with some of
the books recommended in the bibliography.
The presentation is divided in three parts, roughly corresponding to the
three lectures given. In an effort to keep the reader interested, each part
alternates between the fundamental theory of elliptic curves, and applications
in cryptography. We often prefer to have the main ideas flow smoothly, rather
than having a rigorous presentation as one would have in a more classical book.

182,Modeling of drug diffusion in a solid tumor leading to tumor cell death,"  It has been shown recently that changing the fluidic properties of a drug can
improve its efficacy in ablating solid tumors. We develop a modeling framework
for tumor ablation, and present the simplest possible model for drug diffusion
in a spherical tumor with leaky boundaries and assuming cell death eventually
leads to ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities
numerically equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends
on both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to the
cell. Higher oxygen availability leads to cell death at lower drug
concentrations. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required for
a cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The
concentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which allows us
to compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can be plotted at
much finer time intervals compared to that of experiments, which is used to
produce a dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture
of the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the diffusion,
leak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is different for different
individuals and tumors, we produce artificial replication data through
bootstrapping to simulate error. While the usual data-driven model with
Sigmoidal curves use 12 free parameters, our mechanistic model only has two
free parameters, allowing it to be open to scrutiny rather than forcing
agreement with data. Even so, the simplest model in our framework, derived
here, shows close agreement with the bootstrapped curves, and reproduces well
established relations, such as Haber's rule.

183,From 4G to 5G: Self-organized Network Management meets Machine Learning,"  In this paper, we provide an analysis of self-organized network management,
with an end-to-end perspective of the network. Self-organization as applied to
cellular networks is usually referred to Self-organizing Networks (SONs), and
it is a key driver for improving Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
(OAM) activities. SON aims at reducing the cost of installation and management
of 4G and future 5G networks, by simplifying operational tasks through the
capability to configure, optimize and heal itself. To satisfy 5G network
management requirements, this autonomous management vision has to be extended
to the end to end network. In literature and also in some instances of products
available in the market, Machine Learning (ML) has been identified as the key
tool to implement autonomous adaptability and take advantage of experience when
making decisions. In this paper, we survey how network management can
significantly benefit from ML solutions. We review and provide the basic
concepts and taxonomy for SON, network management and ML. We analyse the
available state of the art in the literature, standardization, and in the
market. We pay special attention to 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
evolution in the area of network management and to the data that can be
extracted from 3GPP networks, in order to gain knowledge and experience in how
the network is working, and improve network performance in a proactive way.
Finally, we go through the main challenges associated with this line of
research, in both 4G and in what 5G is getting designed, while identifying new
directions for research.

184,Cyber Risk Analysis of Combined Data Attacks Against Power System State Estimation,"  Understanding smart grid cyber attacks is key for developing appropriate
protection and recovery measures. Advanced attacks pursue maximized impact at
minimized costs and detectability. This paper conducts risk analysis of
combined data integrity and availability attacks against the power system state
estimation. We compare the combined attacks with pure integrity attacks - false
data injection (FDI) attacks. A security index for vulnerability assessment to
these two kinds of attacks is proposed and formulated as a mixed integer linear
programming problem. We show that such combined attacks can succeed with fewer
resources than FDI attacks. The combined attacks with limited knowledge of the
system model also expose advantages in keeping stealth against the bad data
detection. Finally, the risk of combined attacks to reliable system operation
is evaluated using the results from vulnerability assessment and attack impact
analysis. The findings in this paper are validated and supported by a detailed
case study.

185,Poisoning Attacks to Graph-Based Recommender Systems,"  Recommender system is an important component of many web services to help
users locate items that match their interests. Several studies showed that
recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker
injects fake data to a given system such that the system makes recommendations
as the attacker desires. However, these poisoning attacks are either agnostic
to recommendation algorithms or optimized to recommender systems that are not
graph-based. Like association-rule-based and matrix-factorization-based
recommender systems, graph-based recommender system is also deployed in
practice, e.g., eBay, Huawei App Store. However, how to design optimized
poisoning attacks for graph-based recommender systems is still an open problem.
In this work, we perform a systematic study on poisoning attacks to graph-based
recommender systems. Due to limited resources and to avoid detection, we assume
the number of fake users that can be injected into the system is bounded. The
key challenge is how to assign rating scores to the fake users such that the
target item is recommended to as many normal users as possible. To address the
challenge, we formulate the poisoning attacks as an optimization problem,
solving which determines the rating scores for the fake users. We also propose
techniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and
compare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm
and its parameters are known), gray-box (recommendation algorithm is known but
its parameters are unknown), and black-box (recommendation algorithm is
unknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our
attack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based
recommender systems. For instance, when 1% fake users are injected, our attack
can make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain
scenarios.

187,On the Deployment of Distributed Antennas for Wireless Power Transfer with Safety Electromagnetic Radiation Level Requirement,"  The extremely low efficiency is regarded as the bottleneck of Wireless Power
Transfer (WPT) technology. To tackle this problem, either enlarging the
transfer power or changing the infrastructure of WPT system could be an
intuitively proposed way. However, the drastically important issue on the user
exposure of electromagnetic radiation is rarely considered while we try to
improve the efficiency of WPT. In this paper, a Distributed Antenna Power
Beacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where these antennas are uniformly distributed
on a circle is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation
level (SERL) requirement. In this model, three key questions are intended to be
answered: 1) With the SERL, what is the performance of the harvested power at
the users ? 2) How do we configure the parameters to maximize the efficiency of
WPT? 3) Under the same constraints, does the DA-PB still have performance gain
than the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB)? First, the minimum antenna height of
DA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation
power density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL
published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the
closed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user
in the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order
to maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed
antennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the
typical value $2$ and $4$. For comparison, the CA-PB is also analyzed as a
benchmark. Simulation results verify our derived theoretical results. And it is
shown that the proposed DA-PB indeed achieves larger average harvested DC power
than CA-PB and can improve the efficiency of WPT.

188,A simulation technique for slurries interacting with moving parts and deformable solids with applications,"  A numerical method for particle-laden fluids interacting with a deformable
solid domain and mobile rigid parts is proposed and implemented in a full
engineering system. The fluid domain is modeled with a lattice Boltzmann
representation, the particles and rigid parts are modeled with a discrete
element representation, and the deformable solid domain is modeled using a
Lagrangian mesh. The main issue of this work, since separately each of these
methods is a mature tool, is to develop coupling and model-reduction approaches
in order to efficiently simulate coupled problems of this nature, as occur in
various geological and engineering applications. The lattice Boltzmann method
incorporates a large-eddy simulation technique using the Smagorinsky turbulence
model. The discrete element method incorporates spherical and polyhedral
particles for stiff contact interactions. A neo-Hookean hyperelastic model is
used for the deformable solid. We provide a detailed description of how to
couple the three solvers within a unified algorithm. The technique we propose
for rubber modeling/coupling exploits a simplification that prevents having to
solve a finite-element problem each time step. We also develop a technique to
reduce the domain size of the full system by replacing certain zones with
quasi-analytic solutions, which act as effective boundary conditions for the
lattice Boltzmann method. The major ingredients of the routine are are
separately validated. To demonstrate the coupled method in full, we simulate
slurry flows in two kinds of piston-valve geometries. The dynamics of the valve
and slurry are studied and reported over a large range of input parameters.

190,The Two-fold Role of Observables in Classical and Quantum Kinematics,"  Observables have a dual nature in both classical and quantum kinematics: they
are at the same time \emph{quantities}, allowing to separate states by means of
their numerical values, and \emph{generators of transformations}, establishing
relations between different states. In this work, we show how this two-fold
role of observables constitutes a key feature in the conceptual analysis of
classical and quantum kinematics, shedding a new light on the distinguishing
feature of the quantum at the kinematical level. We first take a look at the
algebraic description of both classical and quantum observables in terms of
Jordan-Lie algebras and show how the two algebraic structures are the precise
mathematical manifestation of the two-fold role of observables. Then, we turn
to the geometric reformulation of quantum kinematics in terms of KÃƒÂ¤hler
manifolds. A key achievement of this reformulation is to show that the two-fold
role of observables is the constitutive ingredient defining what an observable
is. Moreover, it points to the fact that, from the restricted point of view of
the transformational role of observables, classical and quantum kinematics
behave in exactly the same way. Finally, we present Landsman's general
framework of Poisson spaces with transition probability, which highlights with
unmatched clarity that the crucial difference between the two kinematics lies
in the way the two roles of observables are related to each other.

security measures to secure multicast time synchronization. We conduct
experiments to verify the computational and communication efficiency for using
these signatures in the standard time synchronization protocols NTP and PTP. We
propose additional security measures to prevent replay attacks and to mitigate
delay attacks. Our proposed solutions cover 1-step mode for NTP and PTP and we

calculate dynamical response functions paving the way to treat large effective

theory and a tight-binding model Hamiltonian, reveal the existence of two
topologically invariant (TI) surface states in the family of cubic Bi
perovskites (ABiO$_3$; A = Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba). The two TI
states, one lying in the valence band (TI-V) and other lying in the conduction
band (TI-C) are formed out of bonding and antibonding states of the
Bi-$\{$s,p$\}$ - O-$\{$p$\}$ coordinated covalent interaction. Below a certain
critical thickness of the film, which varies with A, TI states of top and
bottom surfaces couple to destroy the Dirac type linear dispersion and
consequently to open surface energy gaps. The origin of s-p band inversion,
necessary to form a TI state, classifies the family of ABiO$_3$ into two. For
class-I (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs and Mg) the band inversion, leading to TI-C state,
is induced by spin-orbit coupling of the Bi-p states and for class-II (A = Ca,
Sr and Ba) the band inversion is induced through weak but sensitive second

between local moments and itinerant electrons in the context of pyrochlore
iridates. For the metallic iridate Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, the Ir $5d$ conduction
electrons interact with the Pr $4f$ local moments via the $f$-$d$ exchange.
While the Ir electrons form a Luttinger semimetal, the Pr moments can be tuned
into an ordered spin ice with a finite ordering wavevector, dubbed
""Melko-Hertog-Gingras"" state, by varying Ir and O contents. We point out that
the ordered spin ice of the Pr local moments generates an internal magnetic
field that reconstructs the band structure of the Luttinger semimetal. Besides
the broad existence of Weyl nodes, we predict that the magnetic translation of
the ""Melko-Hertog-Gingras"" state for the Pr moments protects the Dirac band
touching at certain time reversal invariant momenta for the Ir conduction
electrons. We propose the magnetic fields to control the Pr magnetic structure
and thereby indirectly influence the topological and other properties of the Ir
electrons. Our prediction may be immediately tested in the ordered
Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ samples. We expect our work to stimulate a detailed
examination of the band structure, magneto-transport, and other properties of
Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$.

201,A 2-edge partial inverse problem for the Sturm-Liouville operators with singular potentials on a star-shaped graph,"  Boundary value problems for Sturm-Liouville operators with potentials from
the class $W_2^{-1}$ on a star-shaped graph are considered. We assume that the
potentials are known on all the edges of the graph except two, and show that
the potentials on the remaining edges can be constructed by fractional parts of
two spectra. A uniqueness theorem is proved, and an algorithm for the
constructive solution of the partial inverse problem is provided. The main
ingredient of the proofs is the Riesz-basis property of specially constructed
systems of functions.

202,Jastrow form of the Ground State Wave Functions for Fractional Quantum Hall States,"  The topological morphology--order of zeros at the positions of electrons with
respect to a specific electron--of Laughlin state at filling fractions $1/m$
($m$ odd) is homogeneous as every electron feels zeros of order $m$ at the
positions of other electrons. Although fairly accurate ground state wave
functions for most of the other quantum Hall states in the lowest Landau level
are quite well-known, it had been an open problem in expressing the ground
state wave functions in terms of flux-attachment to particles, {\em a la}, this
morphology of Laughlin state. With a very general consideration of
flux-particle relations only, in spherical geometry, we here report a novel
method for determining morphologies of these states. Based on these, we
construct almost exact ground state wave-functions for the Coulomb interaction.
Although the form of interaction may change the ground state wave-function, the
same morphology constructs the latter irrespective of the nature of the
interaction between electrons.

203,On a common refinement of Stark units and Gross-Stark units,"  The purpose of this paper is to formulate and study a common refinement of a
version of Stark's conjecture and its $p$-adic analogue, in terms of Fontaine's
$p$-adic period ring and $p$-adic Hodge theory. We construct period-ring-valued
functions under a generalization of Yoshida's conjecture on the transcendental
parts of CM-periods. Then we conjecture a reciprocity law on their special
values concerning the absolute Frobenius action. We show that our conjecture
implies a part of Stark's conjecture when the base field is an arbitrary real
field and the splitting place is its real place. It also implies a refinement
of the Gross-Stark conjecture under a certain assumption. When the base field
is the rational number field, our conjecture follows from Coleman's formula on
Fermat curves. We also prove some partial results in other cases.

204,An Integrated Decision and Control Theoretic Solution to Multi-Agent Co-Operative Search Problems,"  This paper considers the problem of autonomous multi-agent cooperative target
search in an unknown environment using a decentralized framework under a
no-communication scenario. The targets are considered as static targets and the
agents are considered to be homogeneous. The no-communication scenario
translates as the agents do not exchange either the information about the
environment or their actions among themselves. We propose an integrated
decision and control theoretic solution for a search problem which generates
feasible agent trajectories. In particular, a perception based algorithm is
proposed which allows an agent to estimate the probable strategies of other
agents' and to choose a decision based on such estimation. The algorithm shows
robustness with respect to the estimation accuracy to a certain degree. The
performance of the algorithm is compared with random strategies and numerical
simulation shows considerable advantages.

205,Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition,"  Developing neural network image classification models often requires
significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn
the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach
is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an
architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to
a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new
search space (the ""NASNet search space"") which enables transferability. In our
experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or ""cell"") on the
CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking
together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a
convolutional architecture, named ""NASNet architecture"". We also introduce a
new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly
improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, NASNet
achieves 2.4% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, NASNet
achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7% top-1
and 96.2% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2% better in top-1 accuracy than
the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a
reduction of 28% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art
model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of
NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For
instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74% top-1 accuracy, which is
3.1% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile
platforms. Finally, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN
framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0% achieving 43.1% mAP on the COCO
dataset.

206,Fast Multi-frame Stereo Scene Flow with Motion Segmentation,"  We propose a new multi-frame method for efficiently computing scene flow
(dense depth and optical flow) and camera ego-motion for a dynamic scene
observed from a moving stereo camera rig. Our technique also segments out
moving objects from the rigid scene. In our method, we first estimate the
disparity map and the 6-DOF camera motion using stereo matching and visual
odometry. We then identify regions inconsistent with the estimated camera
motion and compute per-pixel optical flow only at these regions. This flow
proposal is fused with the camera motion-based flow proposal using fusion moves
to obtain the final optical flow and motion segmentation. This unified
framework benefits all four tasks - stereo, optical flow, visual odometry and
motion segmentation leading to overall higher accuracy and efficiency. Our
method is currently ranked third on the KITTI 2015 scene flow benchmark.
Furthermore, our CPU implementation runs in 2-3 seconds per frame which is 1-3
orders of magnitude faster than the top six methods. We also report a thorough
evaluation on challenging Sintel sequences with fast camera and object motion,
where our method consistently outperforms OSF [Menze and Geiger, 2015], which
is currently ranked second on the KITTI benchmark.

$pqr$ where $p,q,r$ are distinct prime numbers. We obtain a complete

many new examples of non-commutative and non-cocommutative finite-dimensional

208,Weak Form of Stokes-Dirac Structures and Geometric Discretization of Port-Hamiltonian Systems,"  We present the mixed Galerkin discretization of distributed parameter
port-Hamiltonian systems. On the prototypical example of hyperbolic systems of
two conservation laws in arbitrary spatial dimension, we derive the main
contributions: (i) A weak formulation of the underlying geometric
(Stokes-Dirac) structure with a segmented boundary according to the causality
of the boundary ports. (ii) The geometric approximation of the Stokes-Dirac
structure by a finite-dimensional Dirac structure is realized using a mixed
Galerkin approach and power-preserving linear maps, which define minimal
discrete power variables. (iii) With a consistent approximation of the
Hamiltonian, we obtain finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian state space models.
By the degrees of freedom in the power-preserving maps, the resulting family of
structure-preserving schemes allows for trade-offs between centered
approximations and upwinding. We illustrate the method on the example of
Whitney finite elements on a 2D simplicial triangulation and compare the
eigenvalue approximation in 1D with a related approach.

209,Clamped seismic metamaterials: Ultra-low broad frequency stop-bands,"  The regularity of earthquakes, their destructive power, and the nuisance of
ground vibration in urban environments, all motivate designs of defence
structures to lessen the impact of seismic and ground vibration waves on
buildings. Low frequency waves, in the range $1$ to $10$ Hz for earthquakes and
up to a few tens of Hz for vibrations generated by human activities, cause a
large amount of damage, or inconvenience, depending on the geological
conditions they can travel considerable distances and may match the resonant
fundamental frequency of buildings. The ultimate aim of any seismic
metamaterial, or any other seismic shield, is to protect over this entire range
of frequencies, the long wavelengths involved, and low frequency, have meant
this has been unachievable to date.
Elastic flexural waves, applicable in the mechanical vibrations of thin
elastic plates, can be designed to have a broad zero-frequency stop-band using
a periodic array of very small clamped circles. Inspired by this experimental
and theoretical observation, all be it in a situation far removed from seismic
waves, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve elastic surface (Rayleigh)
and body (pressure P and shear S) wave reflectors at very large wavelengths in
structured soils modelled as a fully elastic layer periodically clamped to
bedrock.
We identify zero frequency stop-bands that only exist in the limit of columns
of concrete clamped at their base to the bedrock. In a realistic configuration
of a sedimentary basin 15 meters deep we observe a zero frequency stop-band
covering a broad frequency range of $0$ to $30$ Hz.

a result on algebraically degenerate of holomorphic curves intersecting

Smoke Model Evaluation Experiment (FASMEE), are critical for progressing and
transitioning coupled fire-atmosphere models like WRF-SFIRE and WRF-SFIRE-CHEM
into operational use. Historical meteorological data, representing typical
weather conditions for the anticipated burn locations and times, have been
processed to initialize and run a set of simulations representing the planned
experimental burns. Based on an analysis of these numerical simulations, this
paper provides recommendations on the experimental setup that include the
ignition procedures, size and duration of the burns, and optimal sensor
placement. New techniques are developed to initialize coupled fire-atmosphere
simulations with weather conditions typical of the planned burn locations and
time of the year. Analysis of variation and sensitivity analysis of simulation
design to model parameters by repeated Latin Hypercube Sampling are used to
assess the locations of the sensors. The simulations provide the locations of
the measurements that maximize the expected variation of the sensor outputs
with the model parameters.

first theorem is that if the first homology of $X$ is finite cyclic and $M$ is

213,Sparse mean localization by information theory,"  Sparse feature selection is necessary when we fit statistical models, we have
access to a large group of features, don't know which are relevant, but assume
that most are not. Alternatively, when the number of features is larger than
the available data the model becomes over parametrized and the sparse feature
selection task involves selecting the most informative variables for the model.
When the model is a simple location model and the number of relevant features
does not grow with the total number of features, sparse feature selection
corresponds to sparse mean estimation. We deal with a simplified mean
estimation problem consisting of an additive model with gaussian noise and mean
that is in a restricted, finite hypothesis space. This restriction simplifies
the mean estimation problem into a selection problem of combinatorial nature.
Although the hypothesis space is finite, its size is exponential in the
dimension of the mean. In limited data settings and when the size of the
hypothesis space depends on the amount of data or on the dimension of the data,
choosing an approximation set of hypotheses is a desirable approach. Choosing a
set of hypotheses instead of a single one implies replacing the bias-variance
trade off with a resolution-stability trade off. Generalization capacity
provides a resolution selection criterion based on allowing the learning
algorithm to communicate the largest amount of information in the data to the
learner without error. In this work the theory of approximation set coding and
generalization capacity is explored in order to understand this approach. We
then apply the generalization capacity criterion to the simplified sparse mean
estimation problem and detail an importance sampling algorithm which at once
solves the difficulty posed by large hypothesis spaces and the slow convergence
of uniform sampling algorithms.

214,A Closer Look at the Alpha Persei Coronal Conundrum,"  A ROSAT survey of the Alpha Per open cluster in 1993 detected its brightest
star, mid-F supergiant Alpha Persei: the X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness
were similar to coronally active late-type dwarf members. Later, in 2010, a
Hubble Cosmic Origins Spectrograph SNAPshot of Alpha Persei found
far-ultraviolet coronal proxy SiIV unexpectedly weak. This, and a suspicious
offset of the ROSAT source, suggested that a late-type companion might be
responsible for the X-rays. Recently, a multi-faceted program tested that
premise. Groundbased optical coronography, and near-UV imaging with HST Wide
Field Camera 3, searched for any close-in faint candidate coronal objects, but
without success. Then, a Chandra pointing found the X-ray source single and
coincident with the bright star. Significantly, the SiIV emissions of Alpha
Persei, in a deeper FUV spectrum collected by HST COS as part of the joint
program, aligned well with chromospheric atomic oxygen (which must be intrinsic
to the luminous star), within the context of cooler late-F and early-G
supergiants, including Cepheid variables. This pointed to the X-rays as the
fundamental anomaly. The over-luminous X-rays still support the case for a
hyperactive dwarf secondary, albeit now spatially unresolved. However, an
alternative is that Alpha Persei represents a novel class of coronal source.
Resolving the first possibility now has become more difficult, because the easy
solution -- a well separated companion -- has been eliminated. Testing the
other possibility will require a broader high-energy census of the early-F
supergiants.

215,The challenge of realistic music generation: modelling raw audio at scale,"  Realistic music generation is a challenging task. When building generative
models of music that are learnt from data, typically high-level representations
such as scores or MIDI are used that abstract away the idiosyncrasies of a
particular performance. But these nuances are very important for our perception
of musicality and realism, so in this work we embark on modelling music in the
raw audio domain. It has been shown that autoregressive models excel at
generating raw audio waveforms of speech, but when applied to music, we find
them biased towards capturing local signal structure at the expense of
modelling long-range correlations. This is problematic because music exhibits
structure at many different timescales. In this work, we explore autoregressive
discrete autoencoders (ADAs) as a means to enable autoregressive models to
capture long-range correlations in waveforms. We find that they allow us to
unconditionally generate piano music directly in the raw audio domain, which
shows stylistic consistency across tens of seconds.

216,Interpretations of family size distributions: The Datura example,"  Young asteroid families are unique sources of information about fragmentation
physics and the structure of their parent bodies, since their physical
properties have not changed much since their birth. Families have different
properties such as age, size, taxonomy, collision severity and others, and
understanding the effect of those properties on our observations of the
size-frequency distribution (SFD) of family fragments can give us important
insights into the hypervelocity collision processes at scales we cannot achieve
in our laboratories. Here we take as an example the very young Datura family,
with a small 8-km parent body, and compare its size distribution to other
families, with both large and small parent bodies, and created by both
catastrophic and cratering formation events. We conclude that most likely
explanation for the shallower size distribution compared to larger families is
a more pronounced observational bias because of its small size. Its size
distribution is perfectly normal when its parent body size is taken into
account. We also discuss some other possibilities. In addition, we study
another common feature: an offset or ""bump"" in the distribution occurring for a
few of the larger elements. We hypothesize that it can be explained by a newly
described regime of cratering, ""spall cratering"", which controls the majority
of impact craters on the surface of small asteroids like Datura.

218,GENFIRE: A generalized Fourier iterative reconstruction algorithm for high-resolution 3D imaging,"  Tomography has made a radical impact on diverse fields ranging from the study
of 3D atomic arrangements in matter to the study of human health in medicine.
Despite its very diverse applications, the core of tomography remains the same,
that is, a mathematical method must be implemented to reconstruct the 3D
structure of an object from a number of 2D projections. In many scientific
applications, however, the number of projections that can be measured is
limited due to geometric constraints, tolerable radiation dose and/or
acquisition speed. Thus it becomes an important problem to obtain the
best-possible reconstruction from a limited number of projections. Here, we
present the mathematical implementation of a tomographic algorithm, termed
GENeralized Fourier Iterative REconstruction (GENFIRE). By iterating between
real and reciprocal space, GENFIRE searches for a global solution that is
concurrently consistent with the measured data and general physical
constraints. The algorithm requires minimal human intervention and also
incorporates angular refinement to reduce the tilt angle error. We demonstrate
that GENFIRE can produce superior results relative to several other popular
tomographic reconstruction techniques by numerical simulations, and by
experimentally by reconstructing the 3D structure of a porous material and a
frozen-hydrated marine cyanobacterium. Equipped with a graphical user
interface, GENFIRE is freely available from our website and is expected to find
broad applications across different disciplines.

present new measurements of activity and magnetic field proxies of 442 low-mass
K5-M7 dwarfs. The objects were analysed as potential targets to search for
planetary-mass companions with the new spectropolarimeter and high-precision
velocimeter, SPIRou. We have analysed their high-resolution spectra in an
homogeneous way: circular polarisation, chromospheric features, and Zeeman
broadening of the FeH infrared line. The complex relationship between these
activity indicators is analysed: while no strong connection is found between
the large-scale and small-scale magnetic fields, the latter relates with the
non-thermal flux originating in the chromosphere.
We then examine the relationship between various activity diagnostics and the
optical radial-velocity jitter available in the literature, especially for
planet host stars. We use this to derive for all stars an activity merit
function (higher for quieter stars) with the goal of identifying the most
favorable stars where the radial-velocity jitter is low enough for planet
searches. We find that the main contributors to the RV jitter are the
large-scale magnetic field and the chromospheric non-thermal emission.
In addition, three stars (GJ 1289, GJ 793, and GJ 251) have been followed
along their rotation using the spectropolarimetric mode, and we derive their
magnetic topology. These very slow rotators are good representatives of future
SPIRou targets. They are compared to other stars where the magnetic topology is
also known. The poloidal component of the magnetic field is predominent in all
three stars.

elements is desired in various scientific fields such as neuroscience,
geography, economics, etc. Here, we propose an inference procedure for this
goal based on the kinetic Ising model. The procedure is composed of two steps:
(1) determination of the time-bin size for transforming the point-process data
to discrete time binary data and (2) screening of relevant couplings from the
estimated networks. For these, we develop simple methods based on information
theory and computational statistics. Applications to data from artificial and
\textit{in vitro} neuronal networks show that the proposed procedure performs
fairly well when identifying relevant couplings, including the discrimination
of their signs, with low computational cost. These results highlight the
potential utility of the kinetic Ising model to analyze real interacting
systems with event occurrences.

essential task due to the ideal characteristics of the marmoset as a model
organism for neuroscience research. To facilitate this development there is a
need for new computational tools to cross-register multi-modal data sets
containing MRI volumes as well as multiple histological series, and to register
the combined data set to a common reference atlas. We present a fully automatic
pipeline for same-subject-MRI guided reconstruction of image volumes from a
series of histological sections of different modalities, followed by
diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We show registration results for
Nissl, myelin, CTB, and fluorescent tracer images using a same-subject ex-vivo
MRI as our reference and show that our method achieves accurate registration
and eliminates artifactual warping that may be result from the absence of a
reference MRI data set. Examination of the determinant of the local metric
tensor of the diffeomorphic mapping between each subject's ex-vivo MRI and
resultant Nissl reconstruction allows an unprecedented local quantification of
geometrical distortions resulting from the histological processing, showing a
slight shrinkage, a median linear scale change of ~-1% in going from the
ex-vivo MRI to the tape-transfer generated histological image data.

223,A Practical Approach for Successive Omniscience,"  The system that we study in this paper contains a set of users that observe a
discrete memoryless multiple source and communicate via noise-free channels
with the aim of attaining omniscience, the state that all users recover the
entire multiple source. We adopt the concept of successive omniscience (SO),
i.e., letting the local omniscience in some user subset be attained before the
global omniscience in the entire system, and consider the problem of how to
efficiently attain omniscience in a successive manner. Based on the existing
results on SO, we propose a CompSetSO algorithm for determining a complimentary
set, a user subset in which the local omniscience can be attained first without
increasing the sum-rate, the total number of communications, for the global
omniscience. We also derive a sufficient condition for a user subset to be
complimentary so that running the CompSetSO algorithm only requires a lower
bound, instead of the exact value, of the minimum sum-rate for attaining global
omniscience. The CompSetSO algorithm returns a complimentary user subset in
polynomial time. We show by example how to recursively apply the CompSetSO
algorithm so that the global omniscience can be attained by multi-stages of SO.

individual scholars matched with Twitter users made so far. Our methodology
consists of a combination of matching algorithms, considering different
linguistic elements of both author names and Twitter names; followed by a
rule-based scoring system that weights the common occurrence of several
elements related with the names, individual elements and activities of both
Twitter users and scholars matched. Our results indicate that about 2% of the
overall population of scholars in the Web of Science is active on Twitter. By
domain we find a strong presence of researchers from the Social Sciences and
the Humanities. Natural Sciences is the domain with the lowest level of
scholars on Twitter. Researchers on Twitter also tend to be younger than those
that are not on Twitter. As this is a bibliometric-based approach, it is
important to highlight the reliance of the method on the number of publications
produced and tweeted by the scholars, thus the share of scholars on Twitter
ranges between 1% and 5% depending on their level of productivity. Further
research is suggested in order to improve and expand the methodology.

226,Photonic topological pumping through the edges of a dynamical four-dimensional quantum Hall system,"  When a two-dimensional electron gas is exposed to a perpendicular magnetic
field and an in-plane electric field, its conductance becomes quantized in the
transverse in-plane direction: this is known as the quantum Hall (QH) effect.
This effect is a result of the nontrivial topology of the system's electronic
band structure, where an integer topological invariant known as the first Chern
number leads to the quantization of the Hall conductance. Interestingly, it was
shown that the QH effect can be generalized mathematically to four spatial
dimensions (4D), but this effect has never been realized for the obvious reason
that experimental systems are bound to three spatial dimensions. In this work,
we harness the high tunability and control offered by photonic waveguide arrays
to experimentally realize a dynamically-generated 4D QH system using a 2D array
of coupled optical waveguides. The inter-waveguide separation is constructed
such that the propagation of light along the device samples over
higher-dimensional momenta in the directions orthogonal to the two physical
dimensions, thus realizing a 2D topological pump. As a result, the device's
band structure is associated with 4D topological invariants known as second
Chern numbers which support a quantized bulk Hall response with a 4D symmetry.
In a finite-sized system, the 4D topological bulk response is carried by
localized edges modes that cross the sample as a function of of the modulated
auxiliary momenta. We directly observe this crossing through photon pumping
from edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner of our system. These are equivalent to
the pumping of charge across a 4D system from one 3D hypersurface to the
opposite one and from one 2D hyperedge to another, and serve as first
experimental realization of higher-dimensional topological physics.

have a family of morphisms that behave like the counits of a compact closed
category, but have no corresponding units; and they have a `partial' duality
that behaves like transposition in a compact closed category when it is
defined. We axiomatise this structure, which we refer to as a `teleological

categories, and prove a coherence theorem for them. This underpins the use of

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is difficult to realize in quantum materials
because, unlike in ultracold atoms, one cannot tune the pairing interaction. We
realize the BCS-BEC crossover in a nearly compensated semimetal
Fe$_{1+y}$Se$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ by tuning the Fermi energy, $\epsilon_F$, via
chemical doping, which permits us to systematically change $\Delta /
\epsilon_F$ from 0.16 to 0.5 were $\Delta$ is the superconducting (SC) gap. We
use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the Fermi energy, the
SC gap and characteristic changes in the SC state electronic dispersion as the
system evolves from a BCS to a BEC regime. Our results raise important
questions about the crossover in multiband superconductors which go beyond
those addressed in the context of cold atoms.

more recurrent layers sandwiched between an embedding layer used for
representing input tokens and a softmax layer for generating output tokens. For
problems with a very large vocabulary size, the embedding and the softmax
matrices can account for more than half of the model size. For instance, the
bigLSTM model achieves state-of- the-art performance on the One-Billion-Word
(OBW) dataset with around 800k vocabulary, and its word embedding and softmax
matrices use more than 6GBytes space, and are responsible for over 90% of the
model parameters. In this paper, we propose GroupReduce, a novel compression
method for neural language models, based on vocabulary-partition (block) based
low-rank matrix approximation and the inherent frequency distribution of tokens
(the power-law distribution of words). The experimental results show our method
can significantly outperform traditional compression methods such as low-rank
approximation and pruning. On the OBW dataset, our method achieved 6.6 times
compression rate for the embedding and softmax matrices, and when combined with
quantization, our method can achieve 26 times compression rate, which
translates to a factor of 12.8 times compression for the entire model with very
little degradation in perplexity.

231,Morphological characterization of Ge ion implanted SiO2 matrix using multifractal technique,"  200 nm thick SiO2 layers grown on Si substrates and Ge ions of 150 keV energy
were implanted into SiO2 matrix with Different fluences. The implanted samples
were annealed at 950 C for 30 minutes in Ar ambience. Topographical studies of
implanted as well as annealed samples were captured by the atomic force
microscopy (AFM). Two dimension (2D) multifractal detrended fluctuation
analysis (MFDFA) based on the partition function approach has been used to
study the surfaces of ion implanted and annealed samples. The partition
function is used to calculate generalized Hurst exponent with the segment size.
Moreover, it is seen that the generalized Hurst exponents vary nonlinearly with
the moment, thereby exhibiting the multifractal nature. The multifractality of
surface is pronounced after annealing for the surface implanted with fluence
7.5X1016 ions/cm^2.

material with liquid metal, Lead Lithium ( Pb-Li) has been studied under static
condition, maintaining Pb-Li at 550 C for different time durations, 2500, 5000

Microstructure analysis was carried out using SEM and chemical composition by

surface hardness was found to decrease in all the three cases. Grain boundaries
were affected. Some grains got detached from the surface giving rise to pebble

in the tensile strength, after exposure to liquid metal. This paper discusses

233,Magnetocapillary self-assemblies: locomotion and micromanipulation along a liquid interface,"  This paper presents an overview and discussion of magnetocapillary
self-assemblies. New results are presented, in particular concerning the
possible development of future applications. These self-organizing structures
possess the notable ability to move along an interface when powered by an
oscillatory, uniform magnetic field. The system is constructed as follows. Soft
magnetic particles are placed on a liquid interface, and submitted to a
magnetic induction field. An attractive force due to the curvature of the
interface around the particles competes with an interaction between magnetic
dipoles. Ordered structures can spontaneously emerge from these conditions.
Furthermore, time-dependent magnetic fields can produce a wide range of dynamic
behaviours, including non-time-reversible deformation sequences that produce
translational motion at low Reynolds number. In other words, due to a
spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry, the assembly can turn into a
surface microswimmer. Trajectories have been shown to be precisely
controllable. As a consequence, this system offers a way to produce microrobots
able to perform different tasks. This is illustrated in this paper by the
capture, transport and release of a floating cargo, and the controlled mixing
of fluids at low Reynolds number.

234,Bayesian Metabolic Flux Analysis reveals intracellular flux couplings,"  Metabolic flux balance analyses are a standard tool in analysing metabolic
reaction rates compatible with measurements, steady-state and the metabolic
reaction network stoichiometry. Flux analysis methods commonly place
unrealistic assumptions on fluxes due to the convenience of formulating the
problem as a linear programming model, and most methods ignore the notable
uncertainty in flux estimates. We introduce a novel paradigm of Bayesian
metabolic flux analysis that models the reactions of the whole genome-scale
cellular system in probabilistic terms, and can infer the full flux vector
distribution of genome-scale metabolic systems based on exchange and
intracellular (e.g. 13C) flux measurements, steady-state assumptions, and
target function assumptions. The Bayesian model couples all fluxes jointly
together in a simple truncated multivariate posterior distribution, which
reveals informative flux couplings. Our model is a plug-in replacement to
conventional metabolic balance methods, such as flux balance analysis (FBA).
Our experiments indicate that we can characterise the genome-scale flux
covariances, reveal flux couplings, and determine more intracellular unobserved
fluxes in C. acetobutylicum from 13C data than flux variability analysis. The
COBRA compatible software is available at github.com/markusheinonen/bamfa

235,Growing length scale accompanying the vitrification: A perspective based on non-singular density fluctuations,"  In glass forming liquids close to the glass transition point, even a very
slight increase in the macroscopic density results in a dramatic slowing down
of the macroscopic relaxation. Concomitantly, the local density itself
fluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local
density variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective,
a model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is
introduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a
certain threshold value, $\rho_{\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle
rearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period
($\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy
cluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict
that with compression (increasing average density $\rho$) at a fixed
temperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the
clusters, $\xi$, diverges as $\xi\sim(\rho_{\rm c}-\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is
the spatial dimensionality. This $\xi$ measures the average persistence length
of the steric constraints in blocking the rearrangement motions and is
determined by the subsystem density. Additionally, with decreasing $T$ at a
fixed $\rho$, the length scale diverges in the same manner as $\xi\sim(T-T_{\rm
c})^{-2/d}$, for which $\rho$ is identical to $\rho_{\rm c}$ at $T=T_{\rm c}$.
The exponent describing the diverging length scale is the same as the one
predicted by some theoretical models and indeed has been observed in some
simulations and experiments. However, the basic mechanism for this divergence
is different; that is, we do not invoke thermodynamic anomalies associated with
the thermodynamic phase transition as the origin of the growing length scale.
We further present arguements for the cooperative properties based on the
clusters.

236,Many-Objective Pareto Local Search,"  We propose a new Pareto Local Search Algorithm for the many-objective

tool in the case of the bi-objective combinatorial optimization and it was used
in a number of the state-of-the-art algorithms for problems of this kind. On
the other hand, the standard Pareto Local Search algorithm becomes very
inefficient for problems with more than two objectives. We build an effective
Many-Objective Pareto Local Search algorithm using three new mechanisms: the
efficient update of large Pareto archives with ND-Tree data structure, a new
mechanism for the selection of the promising solutions for the neighborhood
exploration, and a partial exploration of the neighborhoods. We apply the
proposed algorithm to the instances of two different problems, i.e. the
traveling salesperson problem and the traveling salesperson problem with
profits with up to 5 objectives showing high effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

sum of Hankel matrices of small rank in correlation with the decomposition of
its symbol $\sigma$ as a sum of polynomial-exponential series. We present a new
algorithm to compute the low rank decomposition of the Hankel operator and the
decomposition of its symbol exploiting the properties of the associated
Artinian Gorenstein quotient algebra A\_$\sigma$. A basis of A\_$\sigma$ is
computed from the Singular Value Decomposition of a sub-matrix of the Hankel
matrix H\_$\sigma$. The frequencies and the weights are deduced from the
generalized eigenvectors of pencils of shifted sub-matrices of H $\sigma$.
Explicit formula for the weights in terms of the eigenvectors avoid us to solve
a Vandermonde system. This new method is a multivariate generalization of the
so-called Pencil method for solving Prony-type decomposition problems. We
analyse its numerical behaviour in the presence of noisy input moments, and
describe a rescaling technique which improves the numerical quality of the
reconstruction for frequencies of high amplitudes. We also present a new Newton
iteration, which converges locally to the closest multivariate Hankel matrix of
low rank and show its impact for correcting errors on input moments.

240,Linear time-periodic dynamical systems: An H2 analysis and a model reduction framework,"  Linear time-periodic (LTP) dynamical systems frequently appear in the
modeling of phenomena related to fluid dynamics, electronic circuits, and
structural mechanics via linearization centered around known periodic orbits of
nonlinear models. Such LTP systems can reach orders that make repeated
simulation or other necessary analysis prohibitive, motivating the need for
model reduction.
We develop here an algorithmic framework for constructing reduced models that
retains the linear time-periodic structure of the original LTP system. Our
approach generalizes optimal approaches that have been established previously
for linear time-invariant (LTI) model reduction problems. We employ an
extension of the usual H2 Hardy space defined for the LTI setting to
time-periodic systems and within this broader framework develop an a posteriori
error bound expressible in terms of related LTI systems. Optimization of this
bound motivates our algorithm. We illustrate the success of our method on two
numerical examples.

produces displacement of the coordinates of each pixel and performs geometric

machine-learning algorithms, especially in support vector machines (SVM). For
nonlinear training instances in machine learning, it often outperforms
polynomial kernels in model accuracy. We use Gaussian kernel profoundly in
formulating nonlinear classical SVM. In the recent research, P. Rebentrost
et.al. discuss a very elegant quantum version of least square support vector
machine using the quantum version of polynomial kernel, which is exponentially
faster than the classical counterparts. In this paper, we have demonstrated a
quantum version of the Gaussian kernel and analyzed its complexity in the
context of quantum SVM. Our analysis shows that the computational complexity of
the quantum Gaussian kernel is O(\epsilon^(-1)logN) with N-dimensional
instances and \epsilon with a Taylor remainder error term |R_m (\epsilon^(-1)

243,Performance of Energy Harvesting Receivers with Power Optimization,"  The difficulty of modeling energy consumption in communication systems leads
to challenges in energy harvesting (EH) systems, in which nodes scavenge energy
from their environment. An EH receiver must harvest enough energy for
demodulating and decoding. The energy required depends upon factors, like code
rate and signal-to-noise ratio, which can be adjusted dynamically. We consider
a receiver which harvests energy from ambient sources and the transmitter,
meaning the received signal is used for both EH and information decoding.
Assuming a generalized function for energy consumption, we maximize the total
number of information bits decoded, under both average and peak power
constraints at the transmitter, by carefully optimizing the power used for EH,
power used for information transmission, fraction of time for EH, and code
rate. For transmission over a single block, we find there exist problem
parameters for which either maximizing power for information transmission or
maximizing power for EH is optimal. In the general case, the optimal solution
is a tradeoff of the two. For transmission over multiple blocks, we give an
upper bound on performance and give sufficient and necessary conditions to
achieve this bound. Finally, we give some numerical results to illustrate our
results and analysis.

244,On Convergence Rate of a Continuous-Time Distributed Self-Appraisal Model with Time-Varying Relative Interaction Matrices,"  This paper studies a recently proposed continuous-time distributed
self-appraisal model with time-varying interactions among a network of $n$
individuals which are characterized by a sequence of time-varying relative
interaction matrices. The model describes the evolution of the
social-confidence levels of the individuals via a reflected appraisal mechanism
in real time. We first show by example that when the relative interaction
matrices are stochastic (not doubly stochastic), the social-confidence levels
of the individuals may not converge to a steady state. We then show that when
the relative interaction matrices are doubly stochastic, the $n$ individuals'
self-confidence levels will all converge to $1/n$, which indicates a democratic
state, exponentially fast under appropriate assumptions, and provide an
explicit expression of the convergence rate.

245,Closing the loop on multisensory interactions: A neural architecture for multisensory causal inference and recalibration,"  When the brain receives input from multiple sensory systems, it is faced with
the question of whether it is appropriate to process the inputs in combination,
as if they originated from the same event, or separately, as if they originated
from distinct events. Furthermore, it must also have a mechanism through which
it can keep sensory inputs calibrated to maintain the accuracy of its internal
representations. We have developed a neural network architecture capable of i)
approximating optimal multisensory spatial integration, based on Bayesian
causal inference, and ii) recalibrating the spatial encoding of sensory
systems. The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing
hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and
the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons.
Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play
dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates
and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of
multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections
spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding
at the level of early unisensory cortices. Our proposed architecture provides
possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and
neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology
with behaviour.

246,Synchronous Observation on the Spontaneous Transformation of Liquid Metal under Free Falling Microgravity Situation,"  The unusually high surface tension of room temperature liquid metal is
molding it as unique material for diverse newly emerging areas. However, unlike
its practices on earth, such metal fluid would display very different behaviors
when working in space where gravity disappears and surface property dominates
the major physics. So far, few direct evidences are available to understand
such effect which would impede further exploration of liquid metal use for
space. Here to preliminarily probe into this intriguing issue, a low cost
experimental strategy to simulate microgravity environment on earth was
proposed through adopting bridges with high enough free falling distance as the
test platform. Then using digital cameras amounted along x, y, z directions on
outside wall of the transparent container with liquid metal and allied solution
inside, synchronous observations on the transient flow and transformational
activities of liquid metal were performed. Meanwhile, an unmanned aerial
vehicle was adopted to record the whole free falling dynamics of the test
capsule from the far end which can help justify subsequent experimental
procedures. A series of typical fundamental phenomena were thus observed as:
(a) A relatively large liquid metal object would spontaneously transform from
its original planar pool state into a sphere and float in the container if
initiating the free falling; (b) The liquid metal changes its three-dimensional
shape due to dynamic microgravity strength due to free falling and rebound of
the test capsule; and (c) A quick spatial transformation of liquid metal
immersed in the solution can easily be induced via external electrical fields.
The mechanisms of the surface tension driven liquid metal actuation in space
were interpreted. All these findings indicated that microgravity effect should
be fully treated in developing future generation liquid metal space
technologies.

247,Continuously tempered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,"  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method for performing approximate inference in complex probabilistic models of
continuous variables. In common with many MCMC methods, however, the standard
HMC approach performs poorly in distributions with multiple isolated modes. We
present a method for augmenting the Hamiltonian system with an extra continuous
temperature control variable which allows the dynamic to bridge between
sampling a complex target distribution and a simpler unimodal base
distribution. This augmentation both helps improve mixing in multimodal targets
and allows the normalisation constant of the target distribution to be
estimated. The method is simple to implement within existing HMC code,
requiring only a standard leapfrog integrator. We demonstrate experimentally
that the method is competitive with annealed importance sampling and simulating
tempering methods at sampling from challenging multimodal distributions and
estimating their normalising constants.

248,Automated Synthesis of Safe Digital Controllers for Sampled-Data Stochastic Nonlinear Systems,"  We present a new method for the automated synthesis of digital controllers
with formal safety guarantees for systems with nonlinear dynamics, noisy output
measurements, and stochastic disturbances. Our method derives digital
controllers such that the corresponding closed-loop system, modeled as a
sampled-data stochastic control system, satisfies a safety specification with
probability above a given threshold. The proposed synthesis method alternates
between two steps: generation of a candidate controller pc, and verification of
the candidate. pc is found by maximizing a Monte Carlo estimate of the safety
probability, and by using a non-validated ODE solver for simulating the system.
Such a candidate is therefore sub-optimal but can be generated very rapidly. To
rule out unstable candidate controllers, we prove and utilize Lyapunov's
indirect method for instability of sampled-data nonlinear systems. In the
subsequent verification step, we use a validated solver based on SMT
(Satisfiability Modulo Theories) to compute a numerically and statistically
valid confidence interval for the safety probability of pc. If the probability
so obtained is not above the threshold, we expand the search space for
candidates by increasing the controller degree. We evaluate our technique on
three case studies: an artificial pancreas model, a powertrain control model,
and a quadruple-tank process.

clustering) have to be used. The multi-factor model is shown to have a
significantly better fit than the Fama-French 5-factor model. Robustness tests

three-body loss coefficients as functions of temperature and scattering volume,
and found that the threshold law and the scattering length scaling law hold in
limited temperature and magnetic field regions. We also found that the

Carr and Nadtochiy by adding drift to the governing underlying process. Still
in this new model it is possible to derive an ordinary differential equation
for the option price which plays a role of Dupire's equation for the standard
local volatility model. It is shown how calibration of multiple smiles (the
whole local volatility surface) can be done in such a case. Further, assuming
the local variance to be a piecewise linear function of strike and piecewise
constant function of time this ODE is solved in closed form in terms of
Confluent hypergeometric functions. Calibration of the model to market smiles
does not require solving any optimization problem and, in contrast, can be done
term-by-term by solving a system of non-linear algebraic equations for each

techniques, two fundamental subtasks that arise are (i) segmentation of the
plain text into meaningful subunits (e.g., entities), and (ii) dependency
parsing, to establish relations between subunits. In this paper, we develop a
relatively simple and effective neural joint model that performs both
segmentation and dependency parsing together, instead of one after the other as
in most state-of-the-art works. We will focus in particular on the real estate
ad setting, aiming to convert an ad to a structured description, which we name
property tree, comprising the tasks of (1) identifying important entities of a
property (e.g., rooms) from classifieds and (2) structuring them into a tree
format. In this work, we propose a new joint model that is able to tackle the
two tasks simultaneously and construct the property tree by (i) avoiding the
error propagation that would arise from the subtasks one after the other in a
pipelined fashion, and (ii) exploiting the interactions between the subtasks.
For this purpose, we perform an extensive comparative study of the pipeline
methods and the new proposed joint model, reporting an improvement of over
three percentage points in the overall edge F1 score of the property tree.
Also, we propose attention methods, to encourage our model to focus on salient
tokens during the construction of the property tree. Thus we experimentally
demonstrate the usefulness of attentive neural architectures for the proposed
joint model, showcasing a further improvement of two percentage points in edge
F1 score for our application.

applications such as angiography, stem cell tracking, and cancer imaging.
Recently, there have been efforts to increase the functionality of MPI via
multi-color imaging methods that can distinguish the responses of different
nanoparticles, or nanoparticles in different environmental conditions. The
proposed techniques typically rely on extensive calibrations that capture the
differences in the harmonic responses of the nanoparticles. In this work, we
propose a method to directly estimate the relaxation time constant of the
nanoparticles from the MPI signal, which is then used to generate a multi-color
relaxation map. The technique is based on the underlying mirror symmetry of the
adiabatic MPI signal when the same region is scanned back and forth. We
validate the proposed method via extensive simulations, and via experiments on
our in-house Magnetic Particle Spectrometer (MPS) setup at 550 Hz and our
in-house MPI scanner at 9.7 kHz. Our results show that nanoparticles can be
successfully distinguished with the proposed technique, without any calibration

routing techniques for radio interference mitigation across multiple coexisting
wireless body area networks (BANs), based on real-life measurements. At the
network layer, the best route is selected according to channel state
information from the physical layer, associated with low duty cycle TDMA at the
MAC layer. The routing techniques (i.e., shortest path routing (SPR), and novel
cooperative multi-path routing (CMR) incorporating 3-branch selection
combining) perform real-time and reliable data transfer across BANs operating
near the 2.4 GHz ISM band. An open-access experimental data set of 'everyday'
mixed-activities is used for analyzing the proposed cross-layer optimization.
We show that CMR gains up to 14 dB improvement with 8.3% TDMA duty cycle, and
even 10 dB improvement with 0.2% TDMA duty cycle over SPR, at 10% outage
probability at a realistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).
Acceptable packet delivery ratios (PDR) and spectral efficiencies are obtained
from SPR and CMR with reasonably sensitive receivers across a range of TDMA low
duty cycles, with up to 9 dB improvement of CMR over SPR at 90% PDR. The
distribution fits for received SINR through routing are also derived and
validated with theoretical analysis.

258,A Team-Formation Algorithm for Faultline Minimization,"  In recent years, the proliferation of online resumes and the need to evaluate
large populations of candidates for on-site and virtual teams have led to a
growing interest in automated team-formation. Given a large pool of candidates,
the general problem requires the selection of a team of experts to complete a
given task. Surprisingly, while ongoing research has studied numerous
variations with different constraints, it has overlooked a factor with a
well-documented impact on team cohesion and performance: team faultlines.
Addressing this gap is challenging, as the available measures for faultlines in
existing teams cannot be efficiently applied to faultline optimization. In this
work, we meet this challenge with a new measure that can be efficiently used
for both faultline measurement and minimization. We then use the measure to
solve the problem of automatically partitioning a large population into
low-faultline teams. By introducing faultlines to the team-formation
literature, our work creates exciting opportunities for algorithmic work on
faultline optimization, as well as on work that combines and studies the
connection of faultlines with other influential team characteristics.

success in many visual recognition tasks. However, existing deep neural network
models are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their
deployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict
latency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model
compression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing
the model performance. During the past few years, tremendous progress has been
made in this area. In this paper, we survey the recent advanced techniques for
compacting and accelerating CNNs model developed. These techniques are roughly
categorized into four schemes: parameter pruning and sharing, low-rank
factorization, transferred/compact convolutional filters, and knowledge
distillation. Methods of parameter pruning and sharing will be described at the
beginning, after that the other techniques will be introduced. For each scheme,
we provide insightful analysis regarding the performance, related applications,
advantages, and drawbacks etc. Then we will go through a few very recent
additional successful methods, for example, dynamic capacity networks and
stochastic depths networks. After that, we survey the evaluation matrix, the
main datasets used for evaluating the model performance and recent benchmarking
efforts. Finally, we conclude this paper, discuss remaining challenges and
possible directions on this topic.

260,Non-Parametric Calibration of Probabilistic Regression,"  The task of calibration is to retrospectively adjust the outputs from a
machine learning model to provide better probability estimates on the target
variable. While calibration has been investigated thoroughly in classification,
it has not yet been well-established for regression tasks. This paper considers
the problem of calibrating a probabilistic regression model to improve the
estimated probability densities over the real-valued targets. We propose to
calibrate a regression model through the cumulative probability density, which
can be derived from calibrating a multi-class classifier. We provide three
non-parametric approaches to solve the problem, two of which provide empirical
estimates and the third providing smooth density estimates. The proposed
approaches are experimentally evaluated to show their ability to improve the
performance of regression models on the predictive likelihood.

261,Cyclotron resonant scattering feature simulations. II. Description of the CRSF simulation process,"  Cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are formed by scattering of
X-ray photons off quantized plasma electrons in the strong magnetic field (of
the order 10^12 G) close to the surface of an accreting X-ray pulsar. The line
profiles of CRSFs cannot be described by an analytic expression. Numerical
methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the scattering processes are
required in order to predict precise line shapes for a given physical setup,
which can be compared to observations to gain information about the underlying
physics in these systems.
A versatile simulation code is needed for the generation of synthetic
cyclotron lines. Sophisticated geometries should be investigatable by making
their simulation possible for the first time.
The simulation utilizes the mean free path tables described in the first
paper of this series for the fast interpolation of propagation lengths. The
code is parallelized to make the very time consuming simulations possible on
convenient time scales. Furthermore, it can generate responses to
mono-energetic photon injections, producing Green's functions, which can be
used later to generate spectra for arbitrary continua.
We develop a new simulation code to generate synthetic cyclotron lines for
complex scenarios, allowing for unprecedented physical interpretation of the
observed data. An associated XSPEC model implementation is used to fit
synthetic line profiles to NuSTAR data of Cep X-4. The code has been developed
with the main goal of overcoming previous geometrical constraints in MC
simulations of CRSFs. By applying this code also to more simple, classic
geometries used in previous works, we furthermore address issues of code
verification and cross-comparison of various models. The XSPEC model and the
Green's function tables are available online at

264,Gini estimation under infinite variance,"  We study the problems related to the estimation of the Gini index in presence
of a fat-tailed data generating process, i.e. one in the stable distribution
class with finite mean but infinite variance (i.e. with tail index
$\alpha\in(1,2)$). We show that, in such a case, the Gini coefficient cannot be
reliably estimated using conventional nonparametric methods, because of a
downward bias that emerges under fat tails. This has important implications for
the ongoing discussion about economic inequality.
We start by discussing how the nonparametric estimator of the Gini index
undergoes a phase transition in the symmetry structure of its asymptotic
distribution, as the data distribution shifts from the domain of attraction of
a light-tailed distribution to that of a fat-tailed one, especially in the case
of infinite variance. We also show how the nonparametric Gini bias increases
with lower values of $\alpha$. We then prove that maximum likelihood estimation
outperforms nonparametric methods, requiring a much smaller sample size to
reach efficiency.
Finally, for fat-tailed data, we provide a simple correction mechanism to the
small sample bias of the nonparametric estimator based on the distance between
the mode and the mean of its asymptotic distribution.

265,Training Neural Networks Using Features Replay,"  Training a neural network using backpropagation algorithm requires passing
error gradients sequentially through the network. The backward locking prevents
us from updating network layers in parallel and fully leveraging the computing
resources. Recently, there are several works trying to decouple and parallelize
the backpropagation algorithm. However, all of them suffer from severe accuracy
loss or memory explosion when the neural network is deep. To address these
challenging issues, we propose a novel parallel-objective formulation for the
objective function of the neural network. After that, we introduce features
replay algorithm and prove that it is guaranteed to converge to critical points
for the non-convex problem under certain conditions. Finally, we apply our
method to training deep convolutional neural networks, and the experimental
results show that the proposed method achieves {faster} convergence, {lower}
memory consumption, and {better} generalization error than compared methods.

the anti-spherical module for any Coxeter group. We deduce that Deodhar's
(sign) parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials have non-negative coefficients,
and that a monotonicity conjecture of Brenti's holds. The main technical
observation is a localisation procedure for the anti-spherical category, from
which we construct a ""light leaves"" basis of morphisms. Our techniques may be
used to calculate many new elements of the $p$-canonical basis in the
anti-spherical module. The results use generators and relations for Soergel
bimodules (""Soergel calculus"") in a crucial way.

267,Trajectories and orbital angular momentum of necklace beams in nonlinear colloidal suspensions,"  Recently, we have predicted that the modulation instability of optical vortex
solitons propagating in nonlinear colloidal suspensions with exponential
saturable nonlinearity leads to formation of necklace beams (NBs)
[S.~Z.~Silahli, W.~Walasik and N.~M.~Litchinitser, Opt.~Lett., \textbf{40},
5714 (2015)]. Here, we investigate the dynamics of NB formation and
propagation, and show that the distance at which the NB is formed depends on
the input power of the vortex beam. Moreover, we show that the NB trajectories
are not necessarily tangent to the initial vortex ring, and that their
velocities have components stemming both from the beam diffraction and from the
beam orbital angular momentum. We also demonstrate the generation of twisted
solitons and analyze the influence of losses on their propagation. Finally, we
investigate the conservation of the orbital angular momentum in necklace and
twisted beams. Our studies, performed in ideal lossless media and in realistic
colloidal suspensions with losses, provide a detailed description of NB
dynamics and may be useful in studies of light propagation in highly scattering
colloids and biological samples.

268,Unified Treatment of Spin Torques using a Coupled Magnetisation Dynamics and Three-Dimensional Spin Current Solver,"  A three-dimensional spin current solver based on a generalised spin
drift-diffusion description, including the spin Hall effect, is integrated with
a magnetisation dynamics solver. The resulting model is shown to simultaneously
reproduce the spin-orbit torques generated using the spin Hall effect, spin
pumping torques generated by magnetisation dynamics in multilayers, as well as
the spin transfer torques acting on magnetisation regions with spatial
gradients, whilst field-like and spin-like torques are reproduced in a spin
valve geometry. Two approaches to modelling interfaces are analysed, one based
on the spin mixing conductance and the other based on continuity of spin
currents where the spin dephasing length governs the absorption of transverse
spin components. In both cases analytical formulas are derived for the
spin-orbit torques in a heavy metal / ferromagnet bilayer geometry, showing in
general both field-like and damping-like torques are generated. The limitations
of the analytical approach are discussed, showing that even in a simple bilayer
geometry, due to the non-uniformity of the spin currents, a full
three-dimensional treatment is required. Finally the model is applied to the
quantitative analysis of the spin Hall angle in Pt by reproducing published
experimental data on the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth in the bilayer
geometry.

$\alpha$ in this equation takes either the value 1 or 0.6 in two- and 0.5 in
three-dimensional systems depending on the pore geometry. Our arguments are

270,Quantum Charge Pumps with Topological Phases in Creutz Ladder,"  Quantum charge pumping phenomenon connects band topology through the dynamics
of a one-dimensional quantum system. In terms of a microscopic model, the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger/Rice-Mele quantum pump continues to serve as a fruitful
starting point for many considerations of topological physics. Here we present
a generalized Creutz scheme as a distinct two-band quantum pump model. By
noting that it undergoes two kinds of topological band transitions accompanying
with a Zak-phase-difference of $\pi$ and $2\pi$, respectively, various charge
pumping schemes are studied by applying an elaborate Peierl's phase
substitution. Translating into real space, the transportation of quantized
charges is a result of cooperative quantum interference effect. In particular,
an all-flux quantum pump emerges which operates with time-varying fluxes only
and transports two charge units. This puts cold atoms with artificial gauge
fields as an unique system where this kind of phenomena can be realized.

271,Fermi acceleration of electrons inside foreshock transient cores,"  Foreshock transients upstream of Earth's bow shock have been recently
observed to accelerate electrons to many times their thermal energy. How such
acceleration occurs is unknown, however. Using THEMIS case studies, we examine
a subset of acceleration events (31 of 247 events) in foreshock transients with
cores that exhibit gradual electron energy increases accompanied by low
background magnetic field strength and large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations.
Using the evolution of electron distributions and the energy increase rates at
multiple spacecraft, we suggest that Fermi acceleration between a converging
foreshock transient's compressional boundary and the bow shock is responsible
for the observed electron acceleration. We then show that a one-dimensional
test particle simulation of an ideal Fermi acceleration model in fluctuating
fields prescribed by the observations can reproduce the observed evolution of
electron distributions, energy increase rate, and pitch-angle isotropy,
providing further support for our hypothesis. Thus, Fermi acceleration is
likely the principal electron acceleration mechanism in at least this subset of
foreshock transient cores.

272,Quantum Speed Limit is Not Quantum,"  The quantum speed limit (QSL), or the energy-time uncertainty relation,
describes the fundamental maximum rate for quantum time evolution and has been
regarded as being unique in quantum mechanics. In this study, we obtain a
classical speed limit corresponding to the QSL using the Hilbert space for the
classical Liouville equation. Thus, classical mechanics has a fundamental speed
limit, and QSL is not a purely quantum phenomenon but a universal dynamical
property of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we obtain similar speed limits for
the imaginary-time Schroedinger equations such as the master equation.

273,Adaptive Diffusion Processes of Time-Varying Local Information on Networks,"  This paper mainly discusses the diffusion on complex networks with
time-varying couplings. We propose a model to describe the adaptive diffusion
process of local topological and dynamical information, and find that the
Barabasi-Albert scale-free network (BA network) is beneficial to the diffusion
and leads nodes to arrive at a larger state value than other networks do. The
ability of diffusion for a node is related to its own degree. Specifically,
nodes with smaller degrees are more likely to change their states and reach
larger values, while those with larger degrees tend to stick to their original
states. We introduce state entropy to analyze the thermodynamic mechanism of
the diffusion process, and interestingly find that this kind of diffusion
process is a minimization process of state entropy. We use the inequality
constrained optimization method to reveal the restriction function of the
minimization and find that it has the same form as the Gibbs free energy. The
thermodynamical concept allows us to understand dynamical processes on complex
networks from a brand-new perspective. The result provides a convenient means
of optimizing relevant dynamical processes on practical circuits as well as
related complex systems.

274,Spectral analysis of jet turbulence,"  Informed by LES data and resolvent analysis of the mean flow, we examine the
structure of turbulence in jets in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic
regimes. Spectral (frequency-space) proper orthogonal decomposition is used to
extract energy spectra and decompose the flow into energy-ranked coherent
structures. The educed structures are generally well predicted by the resolvent
analysis. Over a range of low frequencies and the first few azimuthal mode
numbers, these jets exhibit a low-rank response characterized by
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) type wavepackets associated with the annular shear layer
up to the end of the potential core and that are excited by forcing in the
very-near-nozzle shear layer. These modes too the have been experimentally
observed before and predicted by quasi-parallel stability theory and other
approximations--they comprise a considerable portion of the total turbulent
energy. At still lower frequencies, particularly for the axisymmetric mode, and
again at high frequencies for all azimuthal wavenumbers, the response is not
low rank, but consists of a family of similarly amplified modes. These modes,
which are primarily active downstream of the potential core, are associated
with the Orr mechanism. They occur also as sub-dominant modes in the range of
frequencies dominated by the KH response. Our global analysis helps tie
together previous observations based on local spatial stability theory, and
explains why quasi-parallel predictions were successful at some frequencies and
azimuthal wavenumbers, but failed at others.

subsheaf of the sheaf $\mathfrak{X}$ of vector fields on $M$. We show that if
this singular foliation admits a resolution (in the sense of sheaves)
consisting of sections of a graded vector bundle of finite type, then one can
lift the Lie bracket of vector fields to a Lie $\infty$-algebroid structure on
this resolution, that we call a universal Lie $\infty$-algebroid associated to
the foliation. The name is justified because it is isomorphic (up to homotopy)
to any other Lie $\infty$-algebroid structure built on any other resolution of
the given singular foliation.

277,Distinct evolutions of Weyl fermion quasiparticles and Fermi arcs with bulk band topology in Weyl semimetals,"  The Weyl semimetal phase is a recently discovered topological quantum state
of matter characterized by the presence of topologically protected degeneracies
near the Fermi level. These degeneracies are the source of exotic phenomena,
including the realization of chiral Weyl fermions as quasiparticles in the bulk
and the formation of Fermi arc states on the surfaces. Here, we demonstrate
that these two key signatures show distinct evolutions with the bulk band
topology by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by
first-principle calculations, on transition-metal monophosphides. While Weyl
fermion quasiparticles exist only when the chemical potential is located
between two saddle points of the Weyl cone features, the Fermi arc states
extend in a larger energy scale and are robust across the bulk Lifshitz
transitions associated with the recombination of two non-trivial Fermi surfaces
enclosing one Weyl point into a single trivial Fermi surface enclosing two Weyl
points of opposite chirality. Therefore, in some systems (e.g. NbP),
topological Fermi arc states are preserved even if Weyl fermion quasiparticles
are absent in the bulk. Our findings not only provide insight into the
relationship between the exotic physical phenomena and the intrinsic bulk band
topology in Weyl semimetals, but also resolve the apparent puzzle of the
different magneto-transport properties observed in TaAs, TaP and NbP, where the
Fermi arc states are similar.

blockchain technologies with their profound socioeconomic and sociopolitical
implications, particularly on academic research and the healthcare industry.
Several examples from academia, industry, and healthcare are explored
throughout this paper. The limiting factor in contemporary life sciences
research is often funding: for example, to purchase expensive laboratory
equipment and materials, to hire skilled researchers and technicians, and to
acquire and disseminate data through established academic channels. In the case
of the U.S. healthcare system, hospitals generate massive amounts of data, only
a small minority of which is utilized to inform current and future medical
practice. Similarly, corporations too expend large amounts of money to collect,
secure and transmit data from one centralized source to another. In all three
scenarios, data moves under the traditional paradigm of centralization, in
which data is hosted and curated by individuals and organizations and of
benefit to only a small subset of people.

279,Seismic fragility curves for structures using non-parametric representations,"  Fragility curves are commonly used in civil engineering to assess the
vulnerability of structures to earthquakes. The probability of failure
associated with a prescribed criterion (e.g. the maximal inter-storey drift of
a building exceeding a certain threshold) is represented as a function of the
intensity of the earthquake ground motion (e.g. peak ground acceleration or
spectral acceleration). The classical approach relies on assuming a lognormal
shape of the fragility curves; it is thus parametric. In this paper, we
introduce two non-parametric approaches to establish the fragility curves
without employing the above assumption, namely binned Monte Carlo simulation
and kernel density estimation. As an illustration, we compute the fragility
curves for a three-storey steel frame using a large number of synthetic ground
motions. The curves obtained with the non-parametric approaches are compared
with respective curves based on the lognormal assumption. A similar comparison
is presented for a case when a limited number of recorded ground motions is
available. It is found that the accuracy of the lognormal curves depends on the
ground motion intensity measure, the failure criterion and most importantly, on
the employed method for estimating the parameters of the lognormal shape.

represented as a time-dependent convex combination of metastable states, each
of which is supported on one well.

curve of edges of the $n$-dimensional cube. It bounds a Plateau minimal disk
which Schwarz reflection extends to a complete minimal surface. Studying the
group of Schwarz reflections, we can characterize those Jordan curves for which
the complete surface is embedded. For example, for $n=4$ exactly five such
Jordan curves generate embedded surfaces. Our results apply to surface classes
other than minimal as well, for instance polygonal surfaces.

these planets well-suited for atmospheric studies with the upcoming James Webb

characterize interior structure and atmospheric properties of coeval planets
spanning the rocky to gaseous transition.

283,Human perception in computer vision,"  Computer vision has made remarkable progress in recent years. Deep neural
network (DNN) models optimized to identify objects in images exhibit
unprecedented task-trained accuracy and, remarkably, some generalization
ability: new visual problems can now be solved more easily based on previous
learning. Biological vision (learned in life and through evolution) is also
accurate and general-purpose. Is it possible that these different learning
regimes converge to similar problem-dependent optimal computations? We
therefore asked whether the human system-level computation of visual perception
has DNN correlates and considered several anecdotal test cases. We found that
perceptual sensitivity to image changes has DNN mid-computation correlates,
while sensitivity to segmentation, crowding and shape has DNN end-computation
correlates. Our results quantify the applicability of using DNN computation to
estimate perceptual loss, and are consistent with the fascinating theoretical
view that properties of human perception are a consequence of
architecture-independent visual learning.

average temperature of heating and cooling surfaces, heat spread in the

extended for the estimation of heat transfer requirements at the outer surface

falsehoods through images whose metadata (e.g., captions) have been modified to
provide visual substantiation of the rumor/falsehood. This type of modification
is referred to as image repurposing, in which often an unmanipulated image is
published along with incorrect or manipulated metadata to serve the actor's
ulterior motives. We present the Multimodal Entity Image Repurposing (MEIR)
dataset, a substantially challenging dataset over that which has been
previously available to support research into image repurposing detection. The
new dataset includes location, person, and organization manipulations on
real-world data sourced from Flickr. We also present a novel, end-to-end, deep
multimodal learning model for assessing the integrity of an image by combining
information extracted from the image with related information from a knowledge
base. The proposed method is compared against state-of-the-art techniques on

286,Frank-Wolfe with Subsampling Oracle,"  We analyze two novel randomized variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) or
conditional gradient algorithm. While classical FW algorithms require solving a
linear minimization problem over the domain at each iteration, the proposed
method only requires to solve a linear minimization problem over a small
\emph{subset} of the original domain. The first algorithm that we propose is a
randomized variant of the original FW algorithm and achieves a
$\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ sublinear convergence rate as in the deterministic
counterpart. The second algorithm is a randomized variant of the Away-step FW
algorithm, and again as its deterministic counterpart, reaches linear (i.e.,
exponential) convergence rate making it the first provably convergent
randomized variant of Away-step FW. In both cases, while subsampling reduces
the convergence rate by a constant factor, the linear minimization step can be
a fraction of the cost of that of the deterministic versions, especially when
the data is streamed. We illustrate computational gains of the algorithms on
regression problems, involving both $\ell_1$ and latent group lasso penalties.

288,Bayesian Image Quality Transfer with CNNs: Exploring Uncertainty in dMRI Super-Resolution,"  In this work, we investigate the value of uncertainty modeling in 3D
super-resolution with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Deep learning has
shown success in a plethora of medical image transformation problems, such as
super-resolution (SR) and image synthesis. However, the highly ill-posed nature
of such problems results in inevitable ambiguity in the learning of networks.
We propose to account for intrinsic uncertainty through a per-patch
heteroscedastic noise model and for parameter uncertainty through approximate
Bayesian inference in the form of variational dropout. We show that the
combined benefits of both lead to the state-of-the-art performance SR of
diffusion MR brain images in terms of errors compared to ground truth. We
further show that the reduced error scores produce tangible benefits in
downstream tractography. In addition, the probabilistic nature of the methods
naturally confers a mechanism to quantify uncertainty over the super-resolved
output. We demonstrate through experiments on both healthy and pathological
brains the potential utility of such an uncertainty measure in the risk
assessment of the super-resolved images for subsequent clinical use.

the density of states of a superconductor based on a recently developed
boundary condition for strongly spin-dependent interfaces. We show that the

strongly scattering localized spins leading to the formation of Shiba bands can

290,Long-Term Load Forecasting Considering Volatility Using Multiplicative Error Model,"  Long-term load forecasting plays a vital role for utilities and planners in
terms of grid development and expansion planning. An overestimate of long-term
electricity load will result in substantial wasted investment in the
construction of excess power facilities, while an underestimate of future load
will result in insufficient generation and unmet demand. This paper presents
first-of-its-kind approach to use multiplicative error model (MEM) in
forecasting load for long-term horizon. MEM originates from the structure of
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model where conditional
variance is dynamically parameterized and it multiplicatively interacts with an
innovation term of time-series. Historical load data, accessed from a U.S.
regional transmission operator, and recession data for years 1993-2016 is used
in this study. The superiority of considering volatility is proven by
out-of-sample forecast results as well as directional accuracy during the great
economic recession of 2008. To incorporate future volatility, backtesting of
MEM model is performed. Two performance indicators used to assess the proposed
model are mean absolute percentage error (for both in-sample model fit and
out-of-sample forecasts) and directional accuracy.

291,Geometrically stopped Markovian random growth processes and Pareto tails,"  Many empirical studies document power law behavior in size distributions of
economic interest such as cities, firms, income, and wealth. One mechanism for
generating such behavior combines independent and identically distributed
Gaussian additive shocks to log-size with a geometric age distribution. We
generalize this mechanism by allowing the shocks to be non-Gaussian (but
light-tailed) and dependent upon a Markov state variable. Our main results
provide sharp bounds on tail probabilities and simple formulas for Pareto
exponents. We present two applications: (i) we show that the tails of the
wealth distribution in a heterogeneous-agent dynamic general equilibrium model
with idiosyncratic endowment risk decay exponentially, unlike models with
investment risk where the tails may be Paretian, and (ii) we show that a random
growth model for the population dynamics of Japanese prefectures is consistent
with the observed Pareto exponent but only after allowing for Markovian
dynamics.

292,Graph Clustering using Effective Resistance,"  $ \def\vecc#1{\boldsymbol{#1}} $We design a polynomial time algorithm that
for any weighted undirected graph $G = (V, E,\vecc w)$ and sufficiently large
$\delta > 1$, partitions $V$ into subsets $V_1, \ldots, V_h$ for some $h\geq
1$, such that
$\bullet$ at most $\delta^{-1}$ fraction of the weights are between clusters,
i.e. \[ w(E - \cup_{i = 1}^h E(V_i)) \lesssim \frac{w(E)}{\delta};\]
$\bullet$ the effective resistance diameter of each of the induced subgraphs
$G[V_i]$ is at most $\delta^3$ times the average weighted degree, i.e. \[
\max_{u, v \in V_i} \mathsf{Reff}_{G[V_i]}(u, v) \lesssim \delta^3 \cdot
\frac{|V|}{w(E)} \quad \text{ for all } i=1, \ldots, h.\]
In particular, it is possible to remove one percent of weight of edges of any
given graph such that each of the resulting connected components has effective
resistance diameter at most the inverse of the average weighted degree.
Our proof is based on a new connection between effective resistance and low
conductance sets. We show that if the effective resistance between two vertices
$u$ and $v$ is large, then there must be a low conductance cut separating $u$
from $v$. This implies that very mildly expanding graphs have constant
effective resistance diameter. We believe that this connection could be of
independent interest in algorithm design.

293,Self-supervised learning: When is fusion of the primary and secondary sensor cue useful?,"  Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a reliable learning mechanism in which a
robot enhances its perceptual capabilities. Typically, in SSL a trusted,
primary sensor cue provides supervised training data to a secondary sensor cue.
In this article, a theoretical analysis is performed on the fusion of the
primary and secondary cue in a minimal model of SSL. A proof is provided that
determines the specific conditions under which it is favorable to perform
fusion. In short, it is favorable when (i) the prior on the target value is
strong or (ii) the secondary cue is sufficiently accurate. The theoretical
findings are validated with computational experiments. Subsequently, a
real-world case study is performed to investigate if fusion in SSL is also
beneficial when assumptions of the minimal model are not met. In particular, a
flying robot learns to map pressure measurements to sonar height measurements
and then fuses the two, resulting in better height estimation. Fusion is also
beneficial in the opposite case, when pressure is the primary cue. The analysis
and results are encouraging to study SSL fusion also for other robots and
sensors.

294,Playing Atari with Six Neurons,"  Deep reinforcement learning on Atari games maps pixel directly to actions;
internally, the deep neural network bears the responsibility of both extracting
useful information and making decisions based on it. Aiming at devoting entire
deep networks to decision making alone, we propose a new method for learning
policies and compact state representations separately but simultaneously for
policy approximation in reinforcement learning. State representations are
generated by a novel algorithm based on Vector Quantization and Sparse Coding,
trained online along with the network, and capable of growing its dictionary
size over time. We also introduce new techniques allowing both the neural
network and the evolution strategy to cope with varying dimensions. This
enables networks of only 6 to 18 neurons to learn to play a selection of Atari
games with performance comparable---and occasionally superior---to
state-of-the-art techniques using evolution strategies on deep networks two
orders of magnitude larger.

295,A Systematic Approach for Exploring Tradeoffs in Predictive HVAC Control Systems for Buildings,"  Heating, Ventilation, and Cooling (HVAC) systems are often the most
significant contributor to the energy usage, and the operational cost, of large
office buildings. Therefore, to understand the various factors affecting the
energy usage, and to optimize the operational efficiency of building HVAC
systems, energy analysts and architects often create simulations (e.g.,
EnergyPlus or DOE-2), of buildings prior to construction or renovation to
determine energy savings and quantify the Return-on-Investment (ROI). While
useful, these simulations usually use static HVAC control strategies such as
lowering room temperature at night, or reactive control based on simulated room
occupancy. Recently, advances have been made in HVAC control algorithms that
predict room occupancy. However, these algorithms depend on costly sensor
installations and the tradeoffs between predictive accuracy, energy savings,
comfort and expenses are not well understood. Current simulation frameworks do
not support easy analysis of these tradeoffs. Our contribution is a simulation
framework that can be used to explore this design space by generating objective
estimates of the energy savings and occupant comfort for different levels of
HVAC prediction and control performance. We validate our framework on a
real-world occupancy dataset spanning 6 months for 235 rooms in a large
university office building. Using the gold standard of energy use modeling and
simulation (Revit and Energy Plus), we compare the energy consumption and
occupant comfort in 29 independent simulations that explore our parameter
space. Our results highlight a number of potentially useful tradeoffs with
respect to energy savings, comfort, and algorithmic performance among
predictive, reactive, and static schedules, for a stakeholder of our building.

minimizer, maximizer or saddle point) of a given isolated real critical point
$c$, which is degenerate, of a multivariate polynomial function $f$. To this
end, we introduce the definition of faithful radius of $c$ by means of the
curve of tangency of $f$. We show that the type of $c$ can be determined by the
global extrema of $f$ over the Euclidean ball centered at $c$ with a faithful
radius.We propose algorithms to compute a faithful radius of $c$ and determine
its type.

297,Contribution of Data Categories to Readmission Prediction Accuracy,"  Identification of patients at high risk for readmission could help reduce
morbidity and mortality as well as healthcare costs. Most of the existing
studies on readmission prediction did not compare the contribution of data
categories. In this study we analyzed relative contribution of 90,101 variables
across 398,884 admission records corresponding to 163,468 patients, including
patient demographics, historical hospitalization information, discharge
disposition, diagnoses, procedures, medications and laboratory test results. We
established an interpretable readmission prediction model based on Logistic
Regression in scikit-learn, and added the available variables to the model one
by one in order to analyze the influences of individual data categories on
readmission prediction accuracy. Diagnosis related groups (c-statistic
increment of 0.0933) and discharge disposition (c-statistic increment of
0.0269) were the strongest contributors to model accuracy. Additionally, we
also identified the top ten contributing variables in every data category.

a tropical counterpart of classical linear recurrent sequences). We consider
the case when Newton polygon of the vector has a single (bounded) edge. In this
case there are periodic tropical recurrent sequences which are similar to
classical linear recurrent sequences. A question is studied when there exists a
non-periodic tropical recurrent sequence satisfying a given vector, and partial
answers are provided to this question. Also an algorithm is designed which
tests existence of non-periodic tropical recurrent sequences satisfying a given
vector with integer coordinates. Finally, we introduce a tropical entropy of a
vector and provide some bounds on it.

characterized by Majorana fermions of fractionalized spin excitations, which
are identical to their own antiparticles. Here, we demonstrate emergence of
Majorana fermions thermally fractionalized in the Kitaev honeycomb spin lattice
{\alpha}-RuCl3. The specific heat data unveil the characteristic two-stage
release of magnetic entropy involving localized and itinerant Majorana
fermions. The inelastic neutron scattering results further corroborate these
two distinct fermions by exhibiting quasielastic excitations at low energies
around the Brillouin zone center and Y-shaped magnetic continuum at high
energies, which are evident for the ferromagnetic Kitaev model. Our results
provide an opportunity to build a unified conceptual framework of
fractionalized excitations, applicable also for the quantum Hall states,
superconductors, and frustrated magnets.

300,Haro 11: Where is the Lyman continuum source?,"  Identifying the mechanism by which high energy Lyman continuum (LyC) photons
escaped from early galaxies is one of the most pressing questions in cosmic
evolution. Haro 11 is the best known local LyC leaking galaxy, providing an
important opportunity to test our understanding of LyC escape. The observed LyC
emission in this galaxy presumably originates from one of the three bright,
photoionizing knots known as A, B, and C. It is known that Knot C has strong
Ly$\alpha$ emission, and Knot B hosts an unusually bright ultraluminous X-ray
source, which may be a low-luminosity AGN. To clarify the LyC source, we carry
out ionization-parameter mapping (IPM) by obtaining narrow-band imaging from
the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS cameras to construct spatially resolved
ratio maps of [OIII]/[OII] emission from the galaxy. IPM traces the ionization
structure of the interstellar medium and allows us to identify optically thin
regions. To optimize the continuum subtraction, we introduce a new method for
determining the best continuum scale factor derived from the mode of the
continuum-subtracted, image flux distribution. We find no conclusive evidence
of LyC escape from Knots B or C, but instead, we identify a high-ionization
region extending over at least 1 kpc from Knot A. Knot A shows evidence of an
extremely young age ($\lesssim 1$ Myr), perhaps containing very massive stars
($>100$ M$_\odot$). It is weak in Ly$\alpha$, so if it is confirmed as the LyC
source, our results imply that LyC emission may be independent of Ly$\alpha$
emission.

301,Typed Closure Conversion for the Calculus of Constructions,"  Dependently typed languages such as Coq are used to specify and verify the
full functional correctness of source programs. Type-preserving compilation can
be used to preserve these specifications and proofs of correctness through
compilation into the generated target-language programs. Unfortunately,
type-preserving compilation of dependent types is hard. In essence, the problem
is that dependent type systems are designed around high-level compositional
abstractions to decide type checking, but compilation interferes with the
type-system rules for reasoning about run-time terms.
We develop a type-preserving closure-conversion translation from the Calculus
of Constructions (CC) with strong dependent pairs ($\Sigma$ types)---a subset
of the core language of Coq---to a type-safe, dependently typed compiler
intermediate language named CC-CC. The central challenge in this work is how to
translate the source type-system rules for reasoning about functions into
target type-system rules for reasoning about closures. To justify these rules,
we prove soundness of CC-CC by giving a model in CC. In addition to type
preservation, we prove correctness of separate compilation.

303,Characterizing Exoplanet Habitability,"  A habitable exoplanet is a world that can maintain stable liquid water on its
surface. Techniques and approaches to characterizing such worlds are essential,
as performing a census of Earth-like planets that may or may not have life will
inform our understanding of how frequently life originates and is sustained on
worlds other than our own. Observational techniques like high contrast imaging
and transit spectroscopy can reveal key indicators of habitability for
exoplanets. Both polarization measurements and specular reflectance from oceans
(also known as ""glint"") can provide direct evidence for surface liquid water,
while constraining surface pressure and temperature (from moderate resolution
spectra) can indicate liquid water stability. Indirect evidence for
habitability can come from a variety of sources, including observations of
variability due to weather, surface mapping studies, and/or measurements of
water vapor or cloud profiles that indicate condensation near a surface.
Approaches to making the types of measurements that indicate habitability are
diverse, and have different considerations for the required wavelength range,
spectral resolution, maximum noise levels, stellar host temperature, and
observing geometry.

304,Deep Learning for Classification Tasks on Geospatial Vector Polygons,"  In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of deep learning approaches on
geospatial vector geometry classification tasks. The purpose of this evaluation
is to investigate the ability of deep learning models to learn from geometry
coordinates directly. Previous machine learning research applied to geospatial
polygon data did not use geometries directly, but derived properties thereof.
These are produced by way of extracting geometry properties such as Fourier
descriptors. Instead, our introduced deep neural net architectures are able to
learn on sequences of coordinates mapped directly from polygons. In three
classification tasks we show that the deep learning architectures are
competitive with common learning algorithms that require extracted features.

305,Combining learned and analytical models for predicting action effects,"  One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect
of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal
action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, dynamics are
approximated by physics-based analytical models. These models rely on specific
state representations that may be hard to obtain from raw sensory data,
especially if no knowledge of the object shape is assumed. More recently, we
have seen learning approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical
interactions directly from sensory input. It is however an open question how
far these models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we
investigate the advantages and limitations of neural network based learning
approaches for predicting the effects of actions based on sensory input and
show how analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of
both worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which
there exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We
propose to use a convolutional neural network to convert raw depth images or
organized point clouds into a suitable representation for the analytical model
and compare this approach to using neural networks for both, perception and
prediction. A systematic evaluation of the proposed approach on a very large
real-world dataset shows two main advantages of the hybrid architecture.
Compared to a pure neural network, it significantly (i) reduces required
training data and (ii) improves generalization to novel physical interaction.

306,Leavitt path algebras: Graded direct-finiteness and graded $ÃŽÂ£$-injective simple modules,"  In this paper, we give a complete characterization of Leavitt path algebras
which are graded $\Sigma $-$V$ rings, that is, rings over which a direct sum of
arbitrary copies of any graded simple module is graded injective. Specifically,
we show that a Leavitt path algebra $L$ over an arbitrary graph $E$ is a graded
$\Sigma $-$V$ ring if and only if it is a subdirect product of matrix rings of
arbitrary size but with finitely many non-zero entries over $K$ or
$K[x,x^{-1}]$ with appropriate matrix gradings. We also obtain a graphical
characterization of such a graded $\Sigma $-$V$ ring $L$% . When the graph $E$
is finite, we show that $L$ is a graded $\Sigma $-$V$ ring $\Longleftrightarrow
L$ is graded directly-finite $\Longleftrightarrow L $ has bounded index of
nilpotence $\Longleftrightarrow $ $L$ is graded semi-simple. Examples show that
the equivalence of these properties in the preceding statement no longer holds
when the graph $E$ is infinite. Following this, we also characterize Leavitt
path algebras $L$ which are non-graded $\Sigma $-$V$ rings. Graded rings which
are graded directly-finite are explored and it is shown that if a Leavitt path
algebra $L$ is a graded $\Sigma$-$V$ ring, then $L$ is always graded
directly-finite. Examples show the subtle differences between graded and
non-graded directly-finite rings. Leavitt path algebras which are graded
directly-finite are shown to be directed unions of graded semisimple rings.
Using this, we give an alternative proof of a theorem of VaÃ…Â¡ \cite{V} on
directly-finite Leavitt path algebras.

307,Social media mining for identification and exploration of health-related information from pregnant women,"  Widespread use of social media has led to the generation of substantial
amounts of information about individuals, including health-related information.
Social media provides the opportunity to study health-related information about
selected population groups who may be of interest for a particular study. In
this paper, we explore the possibility of utilizing social media to perform
targeted data collection and analysis from a particular population group --
pregnant women. We hypothesize that we can use social media to identify cohorts
of pregnant women and follow them over time to analyze crucial health-related
information. To identify potentially pregnant women, we employ simple
rule-based searches that attempt to detect pregnancy announcements with
moderate precision. To further filter out false positives and noise, we employ
a supervised classifier using a small number of hand-annotated data. We then
collect their posts over time to create longitudinal health timelines and
attempt to divide the timelines into different pregnancy trimesters. Finally,
we assess the usefulness of the timelines by performing a preliminary analysis
to estimate drug intake patterns of our cohort at different trimesters. Our
rule-based cohort identification technique collected 53,820 users over thirty
months from Twitter. Our pregnancy announcement classification technique
achieved an F-measure of 0.81 for the pregnancy class, resulting in 34,895 user
timelines. Analysis of the timelines revealed that pertinent health-related
information, such as drug-intake and adverse reactions can be mined from the
data. Our approach to using user timelines in this fashion has produced very
encouraging results and can be employed for other important tasks where
cohorts, for which health-related information may not be available from other
sources, are required to be followed over time to derive population-based
estimates.

308,The vortex method for 2D ideal flows in the exterior of a disk,"  The vortex method is a common numerical and theoretical approach used to
implement the motion of an ideal flow, in which the vorticity is approximated
by a sum of point vortices, so that the Euler equations read as a system of
ordinary differential equations. Such a method is well justified in the full
plane, thanks to the explicit representation formulas of Biot and Savart. In an
exterior domain, we also replace the impermeable boundary by a collection of
point vortices generating the circulation around the obstacle. The density of
these point vortices is chosen in order that the flow remains tangent at
midpoints between adjacent vortices. In this work, we provide a rigorous
justification for this method in exterior domains. One of the main mathematical
difficulties being that the Biot-Savart kernel defines a singular integral
operator when restricted to a curve. For simplicity and clarity, we only treat
the case of the unit disk in the plane approximated by a uniformly distributed
mesh of point vortices. The complete and general version of our work is
available in [arXiv:1707.01458].

$\aleph_1$-compactly generated, with the category $K^+ ({\rm R \mbox{-}proj})$
of left bounded complexes of finitely generated projective $R$-modules
providing an essentially small class of such generators. Another proof of
Neeman's theorem is explained, using recent ideas of Christensen and Holm, and
Emmanouil. The strategy of the proof is to show that every complex in $K({\rm R

consider the corresponding inequality constraint set and we study qualification
conditions for perturbations of this set. In particular we prove that all
positive diagonal perturbations, save perhaps a finite number of them, ensure
that any point within the feasible set satisfies Mangasarian-Fromovitz
constraint qualification. Using the Milnor-Thom theorem, we provide a bound for
the number of singular perturbations when the constraints are polynomial
functions. Examples show that the order of magnitude of our exponential bound
is relevant. Our perturbation approach provides a simple protocol to build
sequences of ""regular"" problems approximating an arbitrary
semi-algebraic/definable problem. Applications to sequential quadratic

symplectic manifold (\Gamma,\omega), a hamiltonian $H:\Gamma\to\mathbb{R}$ and
a Lagrangian sub-manifold $M\subset\Gamma$ we find a generalization of the

$H=\frac{1}{2}g^{ij}\left[p_{i}-A_{i}\right]\left[p_{j}-A_{j}\right]+\phi $ of
a particle moving in a gravitational, electromagnetic and scalar fields is
studied in more detail. The integral of the generalized Ricci tensor w.r.t. the
Boltzmann weight reduces to the action principle

312,End-to-End Navigation in Unknown Environments using Neural Networks,"  We investigate how a neural network can learn perception actions loops for
navigation in unknown environments. Specifically, we consider how to learn to
navigate in environments populated with cul-de-sacs that represent convex local
minima that the robot could fall into instead of finding a set of feasible
actions that take it to the goal. Traditional methods rely on maintaining a
global map to solve the problem of over coming a long cul-de-sac. However, due
to errors induced from local and global drift, it is highly challenging to
maintain such a map for long periods of time. One way to mitigate this problem
is by using learning techniques that do not rely on hand engineered map
representations and instead output appropriate control policies directly from
their sensory input. We first demonstrate that such a problem cannot be solved
directly by deep reinforcement learning due to the sparse reward structure of
the environment. Further, we demonstrate that deep supervised learning also
cannot be used directly to solve this problem. We then investigate network
models that offer a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised
learning and highlight the significance of adding fully differentiable memory
units to such networks. We evaluate our networks on their ability to generalize
to new environments and show that adding memory to such networks offers huge
jumps in performance

314,Roche-lobe overflow in eccentric planet-star systems,"  Many giant exoplanets are found near their Roche limit and in mildly
eccentric orbits. In this study we examine the fate of such planets through
Roche-lobe overflow as a function of the physical properties of the binary
components, including the eccentricity and the asynchronicity of the rotating
planet. We use a direct three-body integrator to compute the trajectories of
the lost mass in the ballistic limit and investigate the possible outcomes. We
find three different outcomes for the mass transferred through the Lagrangian
point $L_{1}$: (i) self-accretion by the planet, (ii) direct impact on the
stellar surface, (iii) disk formation around the star. We explore the parameter
space of the three different regimes and find that at low eccentricities,
$e\lesssim 0.2$, mass overflow leads to disk formation for most systems, while
for higher eccentricities or retrograde orbits self-accretion is the only
possible outcome. We conclude that the assumption often made in previous work
that when a planet overflows its Roche lobe it is quickly disrupted and
accreted by the star is not always valid.

I argue that narratives can also become tools for high school students to make
sense of concepts such as the electric field. In this paper I examine high
school students visual and oral narratives in which they describe the
interaction among electric charges as if they were characters of a cartoon
series. The study investigates: given the prompt to produce narratives for
electrostatic phenomena during a classroom activity prior to receiving formal
instruction, (1) what ideas of electrostatics do students attend to in their
narratives?; (2) what role do students narratives play in their understanding
of electrostatics? The participants were a group of high school students
engaged in an open-ended classroom activity prior to receiving formal
instruction about electrostatics. During the activity, the group was asked to
draw comic strips for electric charges. In addition to individual work,
students shared their work within small groups as well as with the whole group.
Post activity, six students from a small group were interviewed individually
about their work. In this paper I present two cases in which students produced
narratives to express their ideas about electrostatics in different ways. In
each case, I present student work for the comic strip activity (visual
narratives), their oral descriptions of their work (oral narratives) during the
interview and/or to their peers during class, and the their ideas of the
electric interactions expressed through their narratives.

318,Preventing Hospital Acquired Infections Through a Workflow-Based Cyber-Physical System,"  Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are infections acquired within the
hospital from healthcare workers, patients or from the environment, but which
have no connection to the initial reason for the patient's hospital admission.
HAI are a serious world-wide problem, leading to an increase in mortality
rates, duration of hospitalisation as well as significant economic burden on
hospitals. Although clear preventive guidelines exist, studies show that
compliance to them is frequently poor. This paper details the software
perspective for an innovative, business process software based cyber-physical
system that will be implemented as part of a European Union-funded research
project. The system is composed of a network of sensors mounted in different
sites around the hospital, a series of wearables used by the healthcare workers
and a server side workflow engine. For better understanding, we describe the
system through the lens of a single, simple clinical workflow that is
responsible for a significant portion of all hospital infections. The goal is
that when completed, the system will be configurable in the sense of
facilitating the creation and automated monitoring of those clinical workflows
that when combined, account for over 90\% of hospital infections.

interesting exercise in its own right: Teleology is rarely useful in physics
--- the only known mainstream physics example (black hole event horizons) has a
very mixed score-card --- so the ""goals"" and ""aims and intentions"" alluded to
in the theme of the 2017 FQXi essay contest are already somewhat pushing the
limits. Furthermore, ""aims and intentions"" certainly carries the implication of
consciousness, and opens up a whole can of worms related to the mind-body
problem. As for ""mindless mathematical laws"", that allusion is certainly in
tension with at least some versions of the ""mathematical universe hypothesis"".
Finally ""wandering towards a goal"" again carries the implication of
consciousness, with all its attendant problems.
In this essay I will argue, simply because we do not yet have any really good
mathematical or physical theory of consciousness, that the theme of this essay
contest is premature, and unlikely to lead to any resolution that would be
widely accepted in the mathematics or physics communities.

321,Phase correction for ALMA - Investigating water vapour radiometer scaling:The long-baseline science verification data case study,"  The Atacama Large millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) makes use of water
vapour radiometers (WVR), which monitor the atmospheric water vapour line at
183 GHz along the line of sight above each antenna to correct for phase delays
introduced by the wet component of the troposphere. The application of WVR
derived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful
observations in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We
present work to indicate that a scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can
act to further improve the phase stability and image quality of ALMA data. We
find reduced phase noise statistics for 62 out of 75 datasets from the
long-baseline science verification campaign after a WVR scaling factor is
applied. The improvement of phase noise translates to an expected coherence
improvement in 39 datasets. When imaging the bandpass source, we find 33 of the
39 datasets show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between a
few to ~30 percent. There are 23 datasets where the S/N of the science image is
improved: 6 by <1%, 11 between 1 and 5%, and 6 above 5%. The higher frequencies
studied (band 6 and band 7) are those most improved, specifically datasets with
low precipitable water vapour (PWV), <1mm, where the dominance of the wet
component is reduced. Although these improvements are not profound, phase
stability improvements via the WVR scaling factor come into play for the higher
frequency (>450 GHz) and long-baseline (>5km) observations. These inherently
have poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (<1mm) conditions for
which we find the scaling to be most effective. A promising explanation for the
scaling factor is the mixing of dry and wet air components, although other
origins are discussed. We have produced a python code to allow ALMA users to
undertake WVR scaling tests and make improvements to their data.

323,When the Universe Expands Too Fast: Relentless Dark Matter,"  We consider a modification to the standard cosmological history consisting of
introducing a new species $\phi$ whose energy density red-shifts with the scale
factor $a$ like $\rho_\phi \propto a^{-(4+n)}$. For $n>0$, such a red-shift is
faster than radiation, hence the new species dominates the energy budget of the
universe at early times while it is completely negligible at late times. If
equality with the radiation energy density is achieved at low enough
temperatures, dark matter can be produced as a thermal relic during the new
cosmological phase. Dark matter freeze-out then occurs at higher temperatures
compared to the standard case, implying that reproducing the observed abundance
requires significantly larger annihilation rates. Here, we point out a
completely new phenomenon, which we refer to as $\textit{relentless}$ dark
matter: for large enough $n$, unlike the standard case where annihilation ends
shortly after the departure from thermal equilibrium, dark matter particles
keep annihilating long after leaving chemical equilibrium, with a significant
depletion of the final relic abundance. Relentless annihilation occurs for $n
\geq 2$ and $n \geq 4$ for s-wave and p-wave annihilation, respectively, and it
thus occurs in well motivated scenarios such as a quintessence with a kination
phase. We discuss a few microscopic realizations for the new cosmological
component and highlight the phenomenological consequences of our calculations
for dark matter searches.

\textit{tangential} polygons) and compute their Morse indices. This setup is
motivated by a number of results about critical points and Morse indices of the
oriented area function defined on the configuration space of polygons with
prescribed edge lengths (flexible polygons). As a by-product, we present an
independent computation of the Morse index of the area function (obtained
earlier by G. Panina and A. Zhukova).

application is topologically protected edge transport in condensed matter
physics. The Chern number, the topological invariant of gapped Bloch
Hamiltonians, is an important quantity in this field. Another example of
topology, in polarization physics, are polarization singularities, called L
lines and C points. By establishing a connection between these two theories, we
develop a novel technique to visualize and potentially measure the Chern
number: it can be expressed either as the winding of the polarization azimuth
along L lines in reciprocal space, or in terms of the handedness and the index
of the C points. For mechanical systems, this is directly connected to the
visible motion patterns.

a geometric proof of the fact that tidiness is equivalent to being minimizing
for a given endomorphism. Our framework also yields an endomorphism version of
the Baumgartner-Willis tree representation theorem. We conclude with a
construction of new endomorphisms of totally disconnected locally compact

329,The Effect of Site-Specific Spectral Densities on the High-Dimensional Exciton-Vibrational Dynamics in the FMO Complex,"  The coupled exciton-vibrational dynamics of a three-site model of the FMO
complex is investigated using the Multi-layer Multi-configuration
Time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) approach. Emphasis is put on the effect of
the spectral density on the exciton state populations as well as on the
vibrational and vibronic non-equilibrium excitations. Models which use either a
single or site-specific spectral densities are contrasted to a spectral density
adapted from experiment. For the transfer efficiency, the total integrated
Huang-Rhys factor is found to be more important than details of the spectral
distributions. However, the latter are relevant for the obtained
non-equilibrium vibrational and vibronic distributions and thus influence the
actual pattern of population relaxation.

330,Space dependent adhesion forces mediated by transient elastic linkages : new convergence and global existence results,"  In the first part of this work we show the convergence with respect to an
asymptotic parameter {\epsilon} of a delayed heat equation. It represents a
mathematical extension of works considered previously by the authors [Milisic
et al. 2011, Milisic et al. 2016]. Namely, this is the first result involving
delay operators approximating protein linkages coupled with a spatial elliptic
second order operator. For the sake of simplicity we choose the Laplace
operator, although more general results could be derived. The main arguments
are (i) new energy estimates and (ii) a stability result extended from the
previous work to this more involved context. They allow to prove convergence of
the delay operator to a friction term together with the Laplace operator in the
same asymptotic regime considered without the space dependence in [Milisic et
al, 2011]. In a second part we extend fixed-point results for the fully
non-linear model introduced in [Milisic et al, 2016] and prove global existence
in time. This shows that the blow-up scenario observed previously does not
occur. Since the latter result was interpreted as a rupture of adhesion forces,
we discuss the possibility of bond breaking both from the analytic and
numerical point of view.

331,Gravitational wave production from preheating: parameter dependence,"  Parametric resonance is among the most efficient phenomena generating
gravitational waves (GWs) in the early Universe. The dynamics of parametric
resonance, and hence of the GWs, depend exclusively on the resonance parameter
$q$. The latter is determined by the properties of each scenario: the initial
amplitude and potential curvature of the oscillating field, and its coupling to
other species. Previous works have only studied the GW production for fixed
value(s) of $q$. We present an analytical derivation of the GW amplitude
dependence on $q$, valid for any scenario, which we confront against numerical
results. By running lattice simulations in an expanding grid, we study for a
wide range of $q$ values, the production of GWs in post-inflationary preheating
scenarios driven by parametric resonance. We present simple fits for the final
amplitude and position of the local maxima in the GW spectrum. Our
parametrization allows to predict the location and amplitude of the GW
background today, for an arbitrary $q$. The GW signal can be rather large, as
$h^2\Omega_{\rm GW}(f_p) \lesssim 10^{-11}$, but it is always peaked at high
frequencies $f_p \gtrsim 10^{7}$ Hz. We also discuss the case of
spectator-field scenarios, where the oscillatory field can be e.g.~a curvaton,
or the Standard Model Higgs.

bands are assigned to the $A-X$ vibrational bands $(v``=0-3, v`=5-10)$ and a
tentative assignment is given to the 2-photon transition from $X$ to the

the IP of SiO to be 11.59(1) eV. The SiO$^{+}$ cation has previously been
identified as a molecular candidate amenable to laser control. Our work allows
us to identify an efficient method for loading cold SiO$^{+}$ from an ablated
sample of SiO into an ion trap via the $(5,0)$ $A-X$ band at 213.977 nm.

333,Adaptive Model Predictive Control for High-Accuracy Trajectory Tracking in Changing Conditions,"  Robots and automated systems are increasingly being introduced to unknown and
dynamic environments where they are required to handle disturbances, unmodeled
dynamics, and parametric uncertainties. Robust and adaptive control strategies
are required to achieve high performance in these dynamic environments. In this
paper, we propose a novel adaptive model predictive controller that combines
model predictive control (MPC) with an underlying $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive
controller to improve trajectory tracking of a system subject to unknown and
changing disturbances. The $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controller forces the
system to behave in a predefined way, as specified by a reference model. A
higher-level model predictive controller then uses this reference model to
calculate the optimal reference input based on a cost function, while taking
into account input and state constraints. We focus on the experimental
validation of the proposed approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in
experiments on a quadrotor. We show that the proposed approach has a lower
trajectory tracking error compared to non-predictive, adaptive approaches and a
predictive, non-adaptive approach, even when external wind disturbances are
applied.

Using Tiles (PRECUT) is a process to convert any complex network into a

338,Topology of Large-Scale Structures of Galaxies in Two Dimensions - Systematic Effects,"  We study the two-dimensional topology of the galactic distribution when
projected onto two-dimensional spherical shells. Using the latest Horizon Run 4
simulation data, we construct the genus of the two-dimensional field and
consider how this statistic is affected by late-time nonlinear effects --
principally gravitational collapse and redshift space distortion (RSD). We also
consider systematic and numerical artifacts such as shot noise, galaxy bias,
and finite pixel effects. We model the systematics using a Hermite polynomial
expansion and perform a comprehensive analysis of known effects on the
two-dimensional genus, with a view toward using the statistic for cosmological
parameter estimation. We find that the finite pixel effect is dominated by an
amplitude drop and can be made less than $1\%$ by adopting pixels smaller than
$1/3$ of the angular smoothing length. Nonlinear gravitational evolution
introduces time-dependent coefficients of the zeroth, first, and second Hermite
polynomials, but the genus amplitude changes by less than $1\%$ between $z=1$
and $z=0$ for smoothing scales $R_{\rm G} > 9 {\rm Mpc/h}$. Non-zero terms are
measured up to third order in the Hermite polynomial expansion when studying
RSD. Differences in shapes of the genus curves in real and redshift space are
small when we adopt thick redshift shells, but the amplitude change remains a
significant $\sim {\cal O}(10\%)$ effect. The combined effects of galaxy
biasing and shot noise produce systematic effects up to the second Hermite
polynomial. It is shown that, when sampling, the use of galaxy mass cuts
significantly reduces the effect of shot noise relative to random sampling.

give rise to interesting processes in symmetric spaces $G/K$. The
$K$-bi-invariant convolution semigroups are a well-studied example. An
appealing direction for the next step is to generalise to right $K$-invariant
convolution semigroups, but recent work of Liao has shown that these are in
one-to-one correspondence with $K$-bi-invariant convolution semigroups. We
investigate a weaker notion of right $K$-invariance, but show that this is, in
fact, the same as the usual notion. Another possible approach is to use
generalised notions of negative definite functions, but this also leads to
nothing new. We finally find an interesting class of convolution semigroups
that are obtained by making use of the Cartan decomposition of a semisimple Lie
group, and the solution of certain stochastic differential equations. Examples
suggest that these are well-suited for generating random motion along geodesics
in symmetric spaces.

342,Toward Optimal Coupon Allocation in Social Networks: An Approximate Submodular Optimization Approach,"  CMO Council reports that 71\% of internet users in the U.S. were influenced
by coupons and discounts when making their purchase decisions. It has also been
shown that offering coupons to a small fraction of users (called seed users)
may affect the purchase decisions of many other users in a social network. This
motivates us to study the optimal coupon allocation problem, and our objective
is to allocate coupons to a set of users so as to maximize the expected
cascade. Different from existing studies on influence maximizaton (IM), our
framework allows a general utility function and a more complex set of
constraints. In particular, we formulate our problem as an approximate
submodular maximization problem subject to matroid and knapsack constraints.
Existing techniques relying on the submodularity of the utility function, such
as greedy algorithm, can not work directly on a non-submodular function. We use
$\epsilon$ to measure the difference between our function and its closest
submodular function and propose a novel approximate algorithm with
approximation ratio $\beta(\epsilon)$ with $\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow
0}\beta(\epsilon)=1-1/e$. This is the best approximation guarantee for
approximate submodular maximization subject to a partition matroid and knapsack
constraints, our results apply to a broad range of optimization problems that
can be formulated as an approximate submodular maximization problem.

performed in order to find the optimal set of nodes which fragments the
original network into the smallest largest connected component. The resulting
attacks are ordered according to the size of the largest connected component
and compared with the state of the art methods of network attacks. We chose
attacks of size $5$ on relative small networks of size $100$ because the number
of all possible attacks, ${100}\choose{5}$ $\approx 10^8$, is at the verge of
the possible to compute with the available standard computers. Besides, we
applied the procedure in a series of networks with controlled and varied
modularity, comparing the resulting statistics with the effect of removing the
same amount of vertices, according to the known most efficient disruption
strategies, i.e., High Betweenness Adaptive attack (HBA), Collective Index
attack (CI), and Modular Based Attack (MBA). Results show that modularity has
an inverse relation with robustness, with $Q_c \approx 0.7$ being the critical
value. For modularities lower than $Q_c$, all heuristic method gives mostly the
same results than with random attacks, while for bigger $Q$, networks are less
robust and highly vulnerable to malicious attacks.

satellite dynamics are open-loop unstable near the desired pointing
configuration. Nevertheless the linearized time-varying system is completely
controllable, under easily verifiable conditions, and the system's disturbance

beneficial interplay between hardware design and control. In the paper,
conditions for the complete controllability for the case of a magnetically

have performed computation by repeatedly transferring data between their
processing and their memory units, which are physically separated. As
computation becomes increasingly data-centric and as the scalability limits in
terms of performance and power are being reached, alternative computing
paradigms are searched for in which computation and storage are collocated. A
fascinating new approach is that of computational memory where the physics of
nanoscale memory devices are used to perform certain computational tasks within
the memory unit in a non-von Neumann manner. Here we present a large-scale
experimental demonstration using one million phase-change memory devices
organized to perform a high-level computational primitive by exploiting the
crystallization dynamics. Also presented is an application of such a
computational memory to process real-world data-sets. The results show that
this co-existence of computation and storage at the nanometer scale could be
the enabler for new, ultra-dense, low power, and massively parallel computing

quantum channel requires to realise a given operator system as its
non-commutative confusability graph. We describe quantum complexity as a
generalised minimum semidefinite rank and, in the case of a graph operator
system, as a quantum intersection number. The quantum complexity and a closely
related quantum version of orthogonal rank turn out to be upper bounds for the
Shannon zero-error capacity of a quantum channel, and we construct examples for
which these bounds beat the best previously known general upper bound for the
capacity of quantum channels, given by the quantum LovÃƒÂ¡sz theta number.

fields, we find for the first time that the transverse momentum distribution of
photoelectrons can be well fitted by a squared zeroth-order Bessel function
because of the quantum interference effect of Glory rescattering. The
characteristic of the Bessel function is determined by the common angular
momentum of a bunch of semiclassical paths termed as Glory trajectories, which
are launched with different nonzero initial transverse momenta distributed on a
specific circle in the momentum plane and finally deflected to the same
asymptotic momentum, which is along the polarization direction, through
post-tunneling rescattering. Glory rescattering theory (GRT) based on the
semiclassical path-integral formalism is developed to address this effect
quantitatively. Our theory can resolve the long-standing discrepancies between
existing theories and experiments on the fringe location, predict the sudden
transition of the fringe structure in holographic patterns, and shed light on
the quantum interference aspects of low-energy structures in strong-field
atomic ionization.

350,Deep Within-Class Covariance Analysis for Robust Audio Representation Learning,"  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn effective features, though
have been shown to suffer from a performance drop when the distribution of the
data changes from training to test data. In this paper we analyze the internal
representations of CNNs and observe that the representations of unseen data in
each class, spread more (with higher variance) in the embedding space of the
CNN compared to representations of the training data. More importantly, this
difference is more extreme if the unseen data comes from a shifted
distribution. Based on this observation, we objectively evaluate the degree of
representation's variance in each class via eigenvalue decomposition on the
within-class covariance of the internal representations of CNNs and observe the
same behaviour. This can be problematic as larger variances might lead to
mis-classification if the sample crosses the decision boundary of its class. We
apply nearest neighbor classification on the representations and empirically
show that the embeddings with the high variance actually have significantly
worse KNN classification performances, although this could not be foreseen from
their end-to-end classification results. To tackle this problem, we propose
Deep Within-Class Covariance Analysis (DWCCA), a deep neural network layer that
significantly reduces the within-class covariance of a DNN's representation,
improving performance on unseen test data from a shifted distribution. We
empirically evaluate DWCCA on two datasets for Acoustic Scene Classification
(DCASE2016 and DCASE2017). We demonstrate that not only does DWCCA
significantly improve the network's internal representation, it also increases
the end-to-end classification accuracy, especially when the test set exhibits a
distribution shift. By adding DWCCA to a VGG network, we achieve around 6
percentage points improvement in the case of a distribution mismatch.

running in real time, on a distributed system. The flagger works on visibility

learns an also n-dimensional embedding of possibly reactive body-affordances
that spread as far as possible throughout the target sensor space.

come from clustering in the representation space learned by the same GAN model.

defined in a way that it effectively has no direct interaction with the
cosmological fluid, although in an equivalent scalar-tensor cosmological setup
the scalar field interacts with the fluid (which we consider to be the

universe at the corresponding stable points matches with that given by the
respective exact solutions we have found in an earlier work (arXiv: 1611.00654

357,J-MOD$^{2}$: Joint Monocular Obstacle Detection and Depth Estimation,"  In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep architecture that jointly learns
to detect obstacles and estimate their depth for MAV flight applications. Most
of the existing approaches either rely on Visual SLAM systems or on depth
estimation models to build 3D maps and detect obstacles. However, for the task
of avoiding obstacles this level of complexity is not required. Recent works
have proposed multi task architectures to both perform scene understanding and
depth estimation. We follow their track and propose a specific architecture to
jointly estimate depth and obstacles, without the need to compute a global map,
but maintaining compatibility with a global SLAM system if needed. The network
architecture is devised to exploit the joint information of the obstacle
detection task, that produces more reliable bounding boxes, with the depth
estimation one, increasing the robustness of both to scenario changes. We call
this architecture J-MOD$^{2}$. We test the effectiveness of our approach with
experiments on sequences with different appearance and focal lengths and
compare it to SotA multi task methods that jointly perform semantic
segmentation and depth estimation. In addition, we show the integration in a
full system using a set of simulated navigation experiments where a MAV
explores an unknown scenario and plans safe trajectories by using our detection
model.

358,The Calabi flow with rough initial data,"  In this paper, we prove that there exists a dimensional constant $\delta > 0$
such that given any background KÃƒÂ¤hler metric $\omega$, the Calabi flow with
initial data $u_0$ satisfying \begin{equation*} \partial \bar \partial u_0 \in
L^\infty (M) \text{ and } (1- \delta )\omega < \omega_{u_0} < (1+\delta
)\omega, \end{equation*} admits a unique short time solution and it becomes
smooth immediately, where $\omega_{u_0} : = \omega +\sqrt{-1}\partial
\bar\partial u_0$. The existence time depends on initial data $u_0$ and the
metric $\omega$. As a corollary, we get that Calabi flow has short time
existence for any initial data satisfying \begin{equation*} \partial \bar
\partial u_0 \in C^0(M) \text{ and } \omega_{u_0} > 0, \end{equation*} which
should be interpreted as a ""continuous KÃƒÂ¤hler metric"". A main technical
ingredient is Schauder-type estimates for biharmonic heat equation on
Riemannian manifolds with time weighted HÃƒÂ¶lder norms.

359,Star Formation Activity in the molecular cloud G35.20$-$0.74: onset of cloud-cloud collision,"  To probe the star-formation (SF) processes, we present results of an analysis
of the molecular cloud G35.20$-$0.74 (hereafter MCG35.2) using multi-frequency
observations. The MCG35.2 is depicted in a velocity range of 30-40 km s$^{-1}$.
An almost horseshoe-like structure embedded within the MCG35.2 is evident in
the infrared and millimeter images and harbors the previously known sites,
ultra-compact/hyper-compact G35.20$-$0.74N H\,{\sc ii} region, Ap2-1, and
Mercer 14 at its base. The site, Ap2-1 is found to be excited by a radio
spectral type of B0.5V star where the distribution of 20 cm and H$\alpha$
emission is surrounded by the extended molecular hydrogen emission. Using the
{\it Herschel} 160-500 $\mu$m and photometric 1-24 $\mu$m data analysis,
several embedded clumps and clusters of young stellar objects (YSOs) are
investigated within the MCG35.2, revealing the SF activities. Majority of the
YSOs clusters and massive clumps (500-4250 M$_{\odot}$) are seen toward the
horseshoe-like structure. The position-velocity analysis of $^{13}$CO emission
shows a blue-shifted peak (at 33 km s$^{-1}$) and a red-shifted peak (at 37 km
s$^{-1}$) interconnected by lower intensity intermediated velocity emission,
tracing a broad bridge feature. The presence of such broad bridge feature
suggests the onset of a collision between molecular components in the MCG35.2.
A noticeable change in the H-band starlight mean polarization angles has also
been observed in the MCG35.2, probably tracing the interaction between
molecular components. Taken together, it seems that the cloud-cloud collision
process has influenced the birth of massive stars and YSOs clusters in the
MCG35.2.

360,Oblivious Routing via Random Walks,"  We present novel oblivious routing algorithms for both splittable and
unsplittable multicommodity flow. Our algorithm for minimizing congestion for
\emph{unsplittable} multicommodity flow is the first oblivious routing
algorithm for this setting. As an intermediate step towards this algorithm, we
present a novel generalization of Valiant's classical load balancing scheme for
packet-switched networks to arbitrary graphs, which is of independent interest.
Our algorithm for minimizing congestion for \emph{splittable} multicommodity
flow improves upon the state-of-the-art, in terms of both running time and
performance, for graphs that exhibit good expansion guarantees. Our algorithms
rely on diffusing traffic via iterative applications of the random walk
operator. Consequently, the performance guarantees of our algorithms are
derived from the convergence of the random walk operator to the stationary
distribution and are expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the graph (which
dominates the mixing time).

fields. We introduce efficient algorithms for methodical computations and
provide the values of various direct and cumulative statistical parameters of
interest. These include: the number of connected functional graphs, the number
of graphs having a maximal cycle, the number of cycles of fixed size, the
number of components of fixed size, as well as the shape of trees extracted
from functional graphs. We particularly focus on connected functional graphs,
that is, the graphs which contain only one component (and thus only one cycle).
Based on the results of our computations, we formulate several conjectures
highlighting the similarities and differences between these functional graphs
and random mappings.

Blumenthal showed in 1905 that decomposition is possible for any asymptotically
weakly decreasing vector field. He used a regularization method in his proof
which can be extended to prove the theorem even for vector fields
asymptotically increasing sublinearly. Blumenthal's result is then applied to
the time-dependent fields of the dipole radiation and an artificial sublinearly

363,A homotopy decomposition of the fibre of the squaring map on $ÃŽÂ©^3S^{17}$,"  We use Richter's $2$-primary proof of Gray's conjecture to give a homotopy
decomposition of the fibre $\Omega^3S^{17}\{2\}$ of the $H$-space squaring map
on the triple loop space of the $17$-sphere. This induces a splitting of the
mod-$2$ homotopy groups $\pi_\ast(S^{17}; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of
the integral homotopy groups of the fibre of the double suspension
$E^2:S^{2n-1} \to \Omega^2S^{2n+1}$ and refines a result of Cohen and Selick,
who gave similar decompositions for $S^5$ and $S^9$. We relate these
decompositions to various Whitehead products in the homotopy groups of mod-$2$
Moore spaces and Stiefel manifolds to show that the Whitehead square $[i_{2n},
i_{2n}]$ of the inclusion of the bottom cell of the Moore space $P^{2n+1}(2)$
is divisible by $2$ if and only if $2n=2, 4, 8$ or $16$.

particular class of one-relator groups. In order to prove the results about
orders, we develop perturbation techniques for actions of these groups on the

365,Stellar streams as gravitational experiments I. The case of Sagittarius,"  Tidal streams of disrupting dwarf galaxies orbiting around their host galaxy
offer a unique way to constrain the shape of galactic gravitational potentials.
Such streams can be used as leaning tower gravitational experiments on galactic
scales. The most well motivated modification of gravity proposed as an
alternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND),
and we present here the first ever N-body simulations of the dynamical
evolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a
realistic baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we attempt to reproduce the
present-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf and its
immense tidal stream that wraps around the Milky Way. With very little freedom
on the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total
luminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size
relation for isolated dwarf galaxies, we find reasonable agreement between our
simulations and observations of this system. The observed stellar velocities in
the leading arm can be reproduced if we include a massive hot gas corona around
the Milky Way that is flattened in the direction of the principal plane of its
satellites. This is the first time that tidal dissolution in MOND has been
tested rigorously at these mass and acceleration scales.

366,Tuning quantum non-local effects in graphene plasmonics,"  The response of an electron system to electromagnetic fields with sharp
spatial variations is strongly dependent on quantum electronic properties, even
in ambient conditions, but difficult to access experimentally. We use
propagating graphene plasmons, together with an engineered dielectric-metallic
environment, to probe the graphene electron liquid and unveil its detailed
electronic response at short wavelengths.The near-field imaging experiments
reveal a parameter-free match with the full theoretical quantum description of
the massless Dirac electron gas, in which we identify three types of quantum
effects as keys to understanding the experimental response of graphene to
short-ranged terahertz electric fields. The first type is of single-particle
nature and is related to shape deformations of the Fermi surface during a
plasmon oscillations. The second and third types are a many-body effect
controlled by the inertia and compressibility of the interacting electron
liquid in graphene. We demonstrate how, in principle, our experimental approach
can determine the full spatiotemporal response of an electron system.

processes on the Sun. High-resolution observations often reveal
multiple-component spectral line profiles, e.g., in the near-infrared He I
10830 \AA\ triplet, which provides information about the chromospheric velocity

small pores and an arch filament system, on 2015 April 17 with the 'very fast
spectroscopic mode' of the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) situated at the
1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. We
discuss this method of obtaining fast (one per minute) spectral scans of the

demonstrate the performance of the 'very fast spectroscopic mode' by tracking
chromospheric high-velocity features in the arch filament system.

368,Rethinking Information Sharing for Actionable Threat Intelligence,"  In the past decade, the information security and threat landscape has grown
significantly making it difficult for a single defender to defend against all
attacks at the same time. This called for introduc- ing information sharing, a
paradigm in which threat indicators are shared in a community of trust to
facilitate defenses. Standards for representation, exchange, and consumption of
indicators are pro- posed in the literature, although various issues are
undermined. In this paper, we rethink information sharing for actionable
intelli- gence, by highlighting various issues that deserve further explo-
ration. We argue that information sharing can benefit from well- defined use
models, threat models, well-understood risk by mea- surement and robust
scoring, well-understood and preserved pri- vacy and quality of indicators and
robust mechanism to avoid free riding behavior of selfish agent. We call for
using the differential nature of data and community structures for optimizing
sharing.

370,Distributive Aronszajn trees,"  Ben-David and Shelah proved that if $\lambda$ is a singular strong-limit
cardinal and $2^\lambda=\lambda^+$, then $\square^*_\lambda$ entails the
existence of a normal $\lambda$-distributive $\lambda^+$-Aronszajn tree. Here,
it is proved that the same conclusion remains valid after replacing the
hypothesis $\square^*_\lambda$ by $\square(\lambda^+,{<}\lambda)$.
As $\square(\lambda^+,{<}\lambda)$ does not impose a bound on the order-type
of the witnessing clubs, our construction is necessarily different from that of
Ben-David and Shelah, and instead uses walks on ordinals augmented with club
guessing.
A major component of this work is the study of postprocessing functions and
their effect on square sequences. A byproduct of this study is the finding that
for $\kappa$ regular uncountable, $\square(\kappa)$ entails the existence of a
partition of $\kappa$ into $\kappa$ many fat sets. When contrasted with a
classic model of Magidor, this shows that it is equiconsistent with the
existence of a weakly compact cardinal that $\omega_2$ cannot be split into two
fat sets.

371,Analytical solutions for the radial Scarf II potential,"  The real Scarf II potential is discussed as a radial problem. This potential
has been studied extensively as a one-dimensional problem, and now these
results are used to construct its bound and resonance solutions for $l=0$ by
setting the origin at some arbitrary value of the coordinate. The solutions
with appropriate boundary conditions are composed as the linear combination of
the two independent solutions of the SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation. The asymptotic
expression of these solutions is used to construct the $S_0(k)$ s-wave
$S$-matrix, the poles of which supply the $k$ values corresponding to the
bound, resonance and anti-bound solutions. The location of the discrete energy
eigenvalues is analyzed, and the relation of the solutions of the radial and
one-dimensional Scarf II potentials is discussed. It is shown that the
generalized Woods--Saxon potential can be generated from the Rosen--Morse II
potential in the same way as the radial Scarf II potential is obtained from its
one-dimensional correspondent. Based on this analogy, possible applications are
also pointed out.

neural networks. The Gated Multimodal Unit (GMU) model is intended to be used
as an internal unit in a neural network architecture whose purpose is to find
an intermediate representation based on a combination of data from different
modalities. The GMU learns to decide how modalities influence the activation of
the unit using multiplicative gates. It was evaluated on a multilabel scenario
for genre classification of movies using the plot and the poster. The GMU
improved the macro f-score performance of single-modality approaches and
outperformed other fusion strategies, including mixture of experts models.
Along with this work, the MM-IMDb dataset is released which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the largest publicly available multimodal dataset for genre
prediction on movies.

373,Why Condorcet Consistency is Essential,"  In a single winner election with several candidates and ranked choice or
rating scale ballots, a Condorcet winner is one who wins all their two way
races by majority rule or MR. A voting system has Condorcet consistency or CC
if it names any Condorcet winner the winner. Many voting systems lack CC, but a
three step line of reasoning is used here to show why it is necessary. In step
1 we show that we can dismiss all the electoral criteria which conflict with
CC. In step 2 we point out that CC follows almost automatically if we can agree
that MR is the only acceptable system for elections with two candidates. In
step 3 we make that argument for MR. This argument itself has three parts.
First, in races with two candidates, the only well known alternatives to MR can
sometimes name as winner a candidate who is preferred over their opponent by
only one voter, with all others preferring the opponent. That is unacceptable.
Second, those same systems are also extremely susceptible to strategic
insincere voting. Third, in simulation studies using spatial models with two
candidates, the best known alternative to MR picks the best or most centrist
candidate significantly less often than MR does.

374,Birefringence induced by pp-wave modes in an electromagnetically active dynamic aether,"  In the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-aether theory we study the
birefringence effect, which can occur in the pp-wave symmetric dynamic aether.
The dynamic aether is considered to be latently birefringent quasi-medium,
which displays this hidden property if and only if the aether motion is
non-uniform, i.e., when the aether flow is characterized by the non-vanishing
expansion, shear, vorticity or acceleration. In accordance with the
dynamo-optical scheme of description of the interaction between electromagnetic
waves and the dynamic aether, we shall model the susceptibility tensors by the
terms linear in the covariant derivative of the aether velocity four-vector.
When the pp-wave modes appear in the dynamic aether, we deal with a
gravitationally induced degeneracy removal with respect to hidden
susceptibility parameters. As a consequence, the phase velocities of
electromagnetic waves possessing orthogonal polarizations do not coincide, thus
displaying the birefringence effect. Two electromagnetic field configurations
are studied in detail: longitudinal and transversal with respect to the aether
pp-wave front. For both cases the solutions are found, which reveal anomalies
in the electromagnetic response on the action of the pp-wave aether mode.

scalability of data collection and accessibility of labels. In this paper, we
present a multi-task domain adaptation framework for instance grasping in
cluttered scenes by utilizing simulated robot experiments. Our neural network
takes monocular RGB images and the instance segmentation mask of a specified
target object as inputs, and predicts the probability of successfully grasping
the specified object for each candidate motor command. The proposed transfer
learning framework trains a model for instance grasping in simulation and uses
a domain-adversarial loss to transfer the trained model to real robots using
indiscriminate grasping data, which is available both in simulation and the
real world. We evaluate our model in real-world robot experiments, comparing it
with alternative model architectures as well as an indiscriminate grasping
baseline.

377,Bounded Depth Ascending HNN Extensions and $Ãâ‚¬_1$-Semistability at $\infty$,"  A 1-ended finitely presented group has semistable fundamental group at
$\infty$ if it acts geometrically on some (equivalently any) simply connected
and locally finite complex $X$ with the property that any two proper rays in
$X$ are properly homotopic. If $G$ has semistable fundamental group at $\infty$
then one can unambiguously define the fundamental group at $\infty$ for $G$.
The problem, asking if all finitely presented groups have semistable
fundamental group at $\infty$ has been studied for over 40 years. If $G$ is an
ascending HNN extension of a finitely presented group then indeed, $G$ has
semistable fundamental group at $\infty$, but since the early 1980's it has
been suggested that the finitely presented groups that are ascending HNN
extensions of {\it finitely generated} groups may include a group with
non-semistable fundamental group at $\infty$. Ascending HNN extensions
naturally break into two classes, those with bounded depth and those with
unbounded depth. Our main theorem shows that bounded depth finitely presented
ascending HNN extensions of finitely generated groups have semistable
fundamental group at $\infty$. Semistability is equivalent to two weaker
asymptotic conditions on the group holding simultaneously. We show one of these
conditions holds for all ascending HNN extensions, regardless of depth. We give
a technique for constructing ascending HNN extensions with unbounded depth.
This work focuses attention on a class of groups that may contain a group with
non-semistable fundamental group at $\infty$.

378,AirSim: High-Fidelity Visual and Physical Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles,"  Developing and testing algorithms for autonomous vehicles in real world is an
expensive and time consuming process. Also, in order to utilize recent advances
in machine intelligence and deep learning we need to collect a large amount of
annotated training data in a variety of conditions and environments. We present
a new simulator built on Unreal Engine that offers physically and visually
realistic simulations for both of these goals. Our simulator includes a physics
engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop
(HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The
simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new
types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the
modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in
other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor
as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software
components with real-world flights.

379,Hausdorff dimensions in $p$-adic analytic groups,"  Let $G$ be a finitely generated pro-$p$ group, equipped with the $p$-power
series. The associated metric and Hausdorff dimension function give rise to the
Hausdorff spectrum, which consists of the Hausdorff dimensions of closed
subgroups of $G$. In the case where $G$ is $p$-adic analytic, the Hausdorff
dimension function is well understood; in particular, the Hausdorff spectrum
consists of finitely many rational numbers closely linked to the analytic
dimensions of subgroups of $G$.
Conversely, it is a long-standing open question whether the finiteness of the
Hausdorff spectrum implies that $G$ is $p$-adic analytic. We prove that the
answer is yes, in a strong sense, under the extra condition that $G$ is
soluble.
Furthermore, we explore the problem and related questions also for other
filtration series, such as the lower $p$-series, the Frattini series, the
modular dimension subgroup series and quite general filtration series. For
instance, we prove, for odd primes $p$, that every countably based pro-$p$
group $G$ with an open subgroup mapping onto 2 copies of the $p$-adic integers
admits a filtration series such that the corresponding Hausdorff spectrum
contains an infinite real interval.

results in forward/feedback control consistent with human intention. It holds
great promise for advancements in patient care and applications to
neurorehabilitation. Here, we propose a novel neurofeedback-based BCI robotic
platform using a personalized social robot in order to assist patients having
cognitive deficits through bilateral rehabilitation and mental training. For
initial testing of the platform, electroencephalography (EEG) brainwaves of a
human user were collected in real time during tasks of imaginary movements.
First, the brainwaves associated with imagined body kinematics parameters were
decoded to control a cursor on a computer screen in training protocol. Then,
the experienced subject was able to interact with a social robot via our
real-time BMI robotic platform. Corresponding to subject's imagery performance,
he/she received specific gesture movements and eye color changes as
neural-based feedback from the robot. This hands-free neurofeedback interaction
not only can be used for mind control of a social robot's movements, but also
sets the stage for application to enhancing and recovering mental abilities
such as attention via training in humans by providing real-time neurofeedback
from a social robot.

Fast response to defects, that can occur not only due to regular wear and tear
but also because of extreme events like storms, is essential. Hence there is a
need for an automated system that is quick, scalable and cost-effective for
gathering information about defects. We propose a system for city-scale road
audit, using some of the most recent developments in deep learning and semantic
segmentation. For building and benchmarking the system, we curated a dataset
which has annotations required for road defects. However, many of the labels
required for road audit have high ambiguity which we overcome by proposing a
label hierarchy. We also propose a multi-step deep learning model that segments
the road, subdivide the road further into defects, tags the frame for each
defect and finally localizes the defects on a map gathered using GPS. We
analyze and evaluate the models on image tagging as well as segmentation at
different levels of the label hierarchy.

382,Mass and moment of inertia govern the transition in the dynamics and wakes of freely rising and falling cylinders,"  In this Letter, we study the motion and wake-patterns of freely rising and
falling cylinders in quiescent fluid. We show that the amplitude of oscillation
and the overall system-dynamics are intricately linked to two parameters: the
particle's mass-density relative to the fluid $m^* \equiv \rho_p/\rho_f$ and
its relative moment-of-inertia $I^* \equiv {I}_p/{I}_f$. This supersedes the
current understanding that a critical mass density ($m^*\approx$ 0.54) alone
triggers the sudden onset of vigorous vibrations. Using over 144 combinations
of ${m}^*$ and $I^*$, we comprehensively map out the parameter space covering
very heavy ($m^* > 10$) to very buoyant ($m^* < 0.1$) particles. The entire
data collapses into two scaling regimes demarcated by a transitional Strouhal
number, $St_t \approx 0.17$. $St_t$ separates a mass-dominated regime from a
regime dominated by the particle's moment of inertia. A shift from one regime
to the other also marks a gradual transition in the wake-shedding pattern: from
the classical $2S$~(2-Single) vortex mode to a $2P$~(2-Pairs) vortex mode.
Thus, auto-rotation can have a significant influence on the trajectories and
wakes of freely rising isotropic bodies.

383,It Takes Two to Tango: Towards Theory of AI's Mind,"  Theory of Mind is the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, intents,
knowledge, perspectives, etc.) to others and recognize that these mental states
may differ from one's own. Theory of Mind is critical to effective
communication and to teams demonstrating higher collective performance. To
effectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make our
lives more productive, it is important for humans and AI to work well together
in a team. Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to make AI
more accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it better understand human
intentions, tendencies, beliefs, and contexts. The latter involves making AI
more human-like and having it develop a theory of our minds. In this work, we
argue that for human-AI teams to be effective, humans must also develop a
theory of AI's mind (ToAIM) - get to know its strengths, weaknesses, beliefs,
and quirks. We instantiate these ideas within the domain of Visual Question
Answering (VQA). We find that using just a few examples (50), lay people can be
trained to better predict responses and oncoming failures of a complex VQA
model. We further evaluate the role existing explanation (or interpretability)
modalities play in helping humans build ToAIM. Explainable AI has received
considerable scientific and popular attention in recent times. Surprisingly, we
find that having access to the model's internal states - its confidence in its
top-k predictions, explicit or implicit attention maps which highlight regions
in the image (and words in the question) the model is looking at (and listening
to) while answering a question about an image - do not help people better
predict its behavior.

Finally, fixing an absolute value $v \in K$ and a variety $V/K$, we descript
the Kawaguchi`s canonical local height $\hat{\lambda}_{V,E,\mathcal{Q},}(.,v)$
as an intersection number, provided that the polarized system $(V,\mathcal{Q})$
has a certain weak NÃƒÂ©ron model over Spec$(\mathcal{O}_v)$ to be defined and
under some conditions depending on the special fiber. With this we extend

385,Enhancing the Spectral Hardening of Cosmic TeV Photons by Mixing with Axionlike Particles in the Magnetized Cosmic Web,"  Large-scale extragalactic magnetic fields may induce conversions between
very-high-energy photons and axionlike particles (ALPs), thereby shielding the
photons from absorption on the extragalactic background light. However, in
simplified ""cell"" models, used so far to represent extragalactic magnetic
fields, this mechanism would be strongly suppressed by current astrophysical
bounds. Here we consider a recent model of extragalactic magnetic fields
obtained from large-scale cosmological simulations. Such simulated magnetic
fields would have large enhancement in the filaments of matter. As a result,
photon-ALP conversions would produce a significant spectral hardening for
cosmic TeV photons. This effect would be probed with the upcoming Cherenkov
Telescope Array detector. This possible detection would give a unique chance to
perform a tomography of the magnetized cosmic web with ALPs.

386,Forecasting in the light of Big Data,"  Predicting the future state of a system has always been a natural motivation
for science and practical applications. Such a topic, beyond its obvious
technical and societal relevance, is also interesting from a conceptual point
of view. This owes to the fact that forecasting lends itself to two equally
radical, yet opposite methodologies. A reductionist one, based on the first
principles, and the naive inductivist one, based only on data. This latter view
has recently gained some attention in response to the availability of
unprecedented amounts of data and increasingly sophisticated algorithmic
analytic techniques. The purpose of this note is to assess critically the role
of big data in reshaping the key aspects of forecasting and in particular the
claim that bigger data leads to better predictions. Drawing on the
representative example of weather forecasts we argue that this is not generally
the case. We conclude by suggesting that a clever and context-dependent
compromise between modelling and quantitative analysis stands out as the best
forecasting strategy, as anticipated nearly a century ago by Richardson and von

E(A) of points of E over the adele ring A of K is a topological group that can
be analyzed in terms of the Galois representation associated to the torsion
points of E. An explicit description of E(A) is given, and we prove that for K
of degree n, almost all elliptic curves over K have an adelic point group
topologically isomorphic to a universal group depending on n. We also show that
there exist infinitely many elliptic curves over K having a different adelic
point group.

388,Fan-type spin structure in uni-axial chiral magnets,"  We investigate the spin structure of a uni-axial chiral magnet near the
transition temperatures in low fields perpendicular to the helical axis. We
find a fan-type modulation structure where the clockwise and counterclockwise
windings appear alternatively along the propagation direction of the modulation
structure. This structure is often realized in a Yoshimori-type (non-chiral)
helimagnet but it is rarely realized in a chiral helimagnet. To discuss
underlying physics of this structure, we reconsider the phase diagram (phase
boundary and crossover lines) through the free energy and asymptotic behaviors
of isolated solitons. The fan structure appears slightly below the phase
boundary of the continuous transition of instability-type. In this region,
there are no solutions containing any types of isolated solitons to the mean
field equations.

389,Rotation of a synchronous viscoelastic shell,"  Several natural satellites of the giant planets have shown evidence of a
global internal ocean, coated by a thin, icy crust. This crust is probably
viscoelastic, which would alter its rotational response. This response would
translate into several rotational quantities, i.e. the obliquity, and the
librations at different frequencies, for which the crustal elasticity reacts
differently. This study aims at modelling the global response of the
viscoelastic crust. For that, I derive the time-dependency of the tensor of
inertia, which I combine with the time evolution of the rotational quantities,
thanks to an iterative algorithm. This algorithm combines numerical simulations
of the rotation with a digital filtering of the resulting tensor of inertia.
The algorithm works very well in the elastic case, provided the problem is not
resonant. However, considering tidal dissipation adds different phase lags to
the oscillating contributions, which challenge the convergence of the
algorithm.

391,"From bare interactions, low--energy constants and unitary gas to nuclear density functionals without free parameters: application to neutron matter","  We further progress along the line of Ref. [Phys. Rev. {\bf A 94}, 043614
(2016)] where a functional for Fermi systems with anomalously large $s$-wave
scattering length $a_s$ was proposed that has no free parameters. The
functional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases
together with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at
low density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities
$\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang
functional, valid for $\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional
retained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional
corresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all
orders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One
conclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density
regime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with
respect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce
density--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare
interaction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some
of the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas
properties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that
the scale in the s-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the
so-called Bertsch parameter $\xi_0$ and becomes independent of $a_s$. We also
point out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those
empirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional. We finally
propose a slight modification of the functional such that it becomes accurate
up to the saturation density $\rho\simeq 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$.

392,EgoCap: Egocentric Marker-less Motion Capture with Two Fisheye Cameras (Extended Abstract),"  Marker-based and marker-less optical skeletal motion-capture methods use an
outside-in arrangement of cameras placed around a scene, with viewpoints
converging on the center. They often create discomfort by possibly needed
marker suits, and their recording volume is severely restricted and often
constrained to indoor scenes with controlled backgrounds. We therefore propose
a new method for real-time, marker-less and egocentric motion capture which
estimates the full-body skeleton pose from a lightweight stereo pair of fisheye
cameras that are attached to a helmet or virtual-reality headset. It combines
the strength of a new generative pose estimation framework for fisheye views
with a ConvNet-based body-part detector trained on a new automatically
annotated and augmented dataset. Our inside-in method captures full-body motion
in general indoor and outdoor scenes, and also crowded scenes.

dimensionality reduction, which are especially useful for the analysis of
coherent structures and nonlinear embeddings of dynamical systems. However, the
computational complexity of the diffusion maps algorithm scales with the number
of observations. Thus, long time-series data presents a significant challenge
for fast and efficient embedding. We propose integrating the NystrÃƒÂ¶m method
with diffusion maps in order to ease the computational demand. We achieve a
speedup of roughly two to four times when approximating the dominant diffusion

394,Multiphase Flows of N Immiscible Incompressible Fluids: An Outflow/Open Boundary Condition and Algorithm,"  We present a set of effective outflow/open boundary conditions and an
associated algorithm for simulating the dynamics of multiphase flows consisting
of $N$ ($N\geqslant 2$) immiscible incompressible fluids in domains involving
outflows or open boundaries. These boundary conditions are devised based on the
properties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability
property ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the
energy balance will not cause the total energy of the N-phase system to
increase over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary conditions are very
effective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems. The
reduction consistency property ensures that if some fluid components are absent
from the N-phase system then these N-phase boundary conditions will reduce to
those corresponding boundary conditions for the equivalent smaller system. Our
numerical algorithm for the proposed boundary conditions together with the
N-phase governing equations involves only the solution of a set of de-coupled
individual Helmholtz-type equations within each time step, and the resultant
linear algebraic systems after discretization involve only constant and
time-independent coefficient matrices which can be pre-computed. Therefore, the
algorithm is computationally very efficient and attractive. We present
extensive numerical experiments for flow problems involving multiple fluid
components and inflow/outflow boundaries to test the proposed method. In
particular, we compare in detail the simulation results of a three-phase
capillary wave problem with Prosperetti's exact physical solution and
demonstrate that the method developed herein produces physically accurate
results.

395,Deadly dark matter cusps vs faint and extended star clusters: Eridanus II and Andromeda XXV,"  The recent detection of two faint and extended star clusters in the central
regions of two Local Group dwarf galaxies, Eridanus II and Andromeda XXV,
raises the question of whether clusters with such low densities can survive the
tidal field of cold dark matter haloes with central density cusps. Using both
analytic arguments and a suite of collisionless N-body simulations, I show that
these clusters are extremely fragile and quickly disrupted in the presence of
central cusps $\rho\sim r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\gtrsim 0.2$. Furthermore, the
scenario in which the clusters where originally more massive and sank to the
center of the halo requires extreme fine tuning and does not naturally
reproduce the observed systems. In turn, these clusters are long lived in cored
haloes, whose central regions are safe shelters for $\alpha\lesssim 0.2$. The
only viable scenario for hosts that have preserved their primoridal cusp to the
present time is that the clusters formed at rest at the bottom of the
potential, which is easily tested by measurement of the clusters proper
velocity within the host. This offers means to readily probe the central
density profile of two dwarf galaxies as faint as $L_V\sim5\times 10^5 L_\odot$
and $L_V\sim6\times10^4 L_\odot$, in which stellar feedback is unlikely to be
effective.

396,"Mutual Information, Relative Entropy and Estimation Error in Semi-martingale Channels","  Fundamental relations between information and estimation have been
established in the literature for the continuous-time Gaussian and Poisson
channels, in a long line of work starting from the classical representation
theorems by Duncan and Kabanov respectively. In this work, we demonstrate that
such relations hold for a much larger family of continuous-time channels. We
introduce the family of semi-martingale channels where the channel output is a
semi-martingale stochastic process, and the channel input modulates the
characteristics of the semi-martingale. For these channels, which includes as a
special case the continuous time Gaussian and Poisson models, we establish new
representations relating the mutual information between the channel input and
output to an optimal causal filtering loss, thereby unifying and considerably
extending results from the Gaussian and Poisson settings. Extensions to the
setting of mismatched estimation are also presented where the relative entropy
between the laws governing the output of the channel under two different input
distributions is equal to the cumulative difference between the estimation loss
incurred by using the mismatched and optimal causal filters respectively. The
main tool underlying these results is the Doob--Meyer decomposition of a class
of likelihood ratio sub-martingales. The results in this work can be viewed as
the continuous-time analogues of recent generalizations for relations between
information and estimation for discrete-time LÃƒÂ©vy channels.

397,Testing redMaPPer centring probabilities using galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing,"  Galaxy cluster centring is a key issue for precision cosmology studies using
galaxy surveys. Mis-identification of central galaxies causes systematics in
various studies such as cluster lensing, satellite kinematics, and galaxy
clustering. The red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation
(redMaPPer) estimates the probability that each member galaxy is central from
photometric information rather than specifying one central galaxy. The
redMaPPer estimates can be used for calibrating the off-centring effect,
however, the centring algorithm has not previously been well-tested. We test
the centring probabilities of redMaPPer cluster catalog using the projected
cross correlation between redMaPPer clusters with photometric red galaxies and
galaxy-galaxy lensing. We focus on the subsample of redMaPPer clusters in which
the redMaPPer central galaxies (RMCGs) are not the brightest member galaxies
(BMEM) and both of them have spectroscopic redshift. This subsample represents
nearly 10% of the whole cluster sample. We find a clear difference in the
cross-correlation measurements between RMCGs and BMEMs, and the estimated
centring probability is 74$\pm$10% for RMCGs and 13$\pm$4% for BMEMs in the
Gaussian offset model and 78$\pm$9% for RMCGs and 5$\pm$5% for BMEMs in the NFW
offset model. These values are in agreement with the centring probability
values reported by redMaPPer (75% for RMCG and 10% for BMEMs) within 1$\sigma$.
Our analysis provides a strong consistency test of the redMaPPer centring
probabilities. Our results suggest that redMaPPer centring probabilities are
reliably estimated. We confirm that the brightest galaxy in the cluster is not
always the central galaxy as has been shown in previous works.

400,Kinetic modelling of competition and depletion of shared miRNAs by competing endogenous RNAs,"  Non-conding RNAs play a key role in the post-transcriptional regulation of
mRNA translation and turnover in eukaryotes. miRNAs, in particular, interact
with their target RNAs through protein-mediated, sequence-specific binding,
giving rise to extended and highly heterogeneous miRNA-RNA interaction
networks. Within such networks, competition to bind miRNAs can generate an
effective positive coupling between their targets. Competing endogenous RNAs
(ceRNAs) can in turn regulate each other through miRNA-mediated crosstalk.
Albeit potentially weak, ceRNA interactions can occur both dynamically,
affecting e.g. the regulatory clock, and at stationarity, in which case ceRNA
networks as a whole can be implicated in the composition of the cell's
proteome. Many features of ceRNA interactions, including the conditions under
which they become significant, can be unraveled by mathematical and in silico
models. We review the understanding of the ceRNA effect obtained within such
frameworks, focusing on the methods employed to quantify it, its role in the
processing of gene expression noise, and how network topology can determine its
reach.

the goal is to select a set of seed nodes with the minimum total cost such that
the expected number of influenced nodes in the network exceeds a predefined
threshold. We propose several algorithms that outperform the previous studies
both on the theoretical approximation ratios and on the experimental
performance. Under the case where the nodes have heterogeneous costs, our
algorithms are the first bi- criteria approximation algorithms with polynomial
running time and provable logarithmic performance bounds using a general
contagion model. Under the case where the users have uniform costs, our
algorithms achieve logarithmic approximation ratio and provable time complexity
which is smaller than that of existing algorithms in orders of magnitude. We
conduct extensive experiments using real social networks. The experimental
results show that, our algorithms significantly outperform the existing
algorithms both on the total cost and on the running time, and also scale well
to billion-scale networks.

energies are a natural route to obtain highly accurate results with
controllable errors. However, the unfavorable scaling and the resulting high
computational cost of standard variational approaches limit their application
to small molecules with only few vibrational modes. Here, we demonstrate how
the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) can be exploited to optimize
vibrational wave functions (vDMRG) expressed as matrix product states. We study
the convergence of these calculations with respect to the size of the local
basis of each mode, the number of renormalized block states, and the number of
DMRG sweeps required. We demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by vDMRG for
small molecules that were intensively studied in the literature. We then
proceed to show that the complete fingerprint region of the sarcosyn-glycin
dipeptide can be calculated with vDMRG.

efficient use of its exploratory actions by autonomously identifying possible
objectives in its environment and learning them in parallel. The identification
of objectives is achieved using an online and unsupervised adaptive clustering
algorithm. The identified objectives are learned (at least partially) in
parallel using Q-learning. Using a simulated agent and environment, it is shown
that the converged or partially converged value function weights resulting from
off-policy learning can be used to accumulate knowledge about multiple
objectives without any additional exploration. We claim that the proposed
approach could be useful in scenarios where the objectives are initially
unknown or in real world scenarios where exploration is typically a time and
energy intensive process. The implications and possible extensions of this work
are also briefly discussed.

408,Anisotropy and multiband superconductivity in Sr2RuO4,"  Despite numerous studies the exact nature of the order parameter in
superconducting Sr2RuO4 remains unresolved. We have extended previous
small-angle neutron scattering studies of the vortex lattice in this material
to a wider field range, higher temperatures, and with the field applied close
to both the <100> and <110> basal plane directions. Measurements at high field
were made possible by the use of both spin polarization and analysis to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. Rotating the field towards the basal plane causes a
distortion of the square vortex lattice observed for H // <001>, and also a
symmetry change to a distorted triangular symmetry for fields close to <100>.
The vortex lattice distortion allows us to determine the intrinsic
superconducting anisotropy between the c-axis and the Ru-O basal plane,
yielding a value of ~60 at low temperature and low to intermediate fields. This
greatly exceeds the upper critical field anisotropy of ~20 at low temperature,
reminiscent of Pauli limiting. Indirect evidence for Pauli paramagnetic effects
on the unpaired quasiparticles in the vortex cores are observed, but a direct
detection lies below the measurement sensitivity. The superconducting
anisotropy is found to be independent of temperature but increases for fields >
1 T, indicating multiband superconductvity in Sr2RuO4. Finally, the temperature
dependence of the scattered intensity provides further support for gap nodes or
deep minima in the superconducting gap.

degenerate fundamental quarks with mass $m$ and a $\theta$-parameter. For
generic $m$ and $\theta$ the theory has a single gapped vacuum. However, as
$\theta$ is varied through $\theta=\pi$ for large $m$ there is a first order
transition. For $N_f=1$ the first order transition line ends at a point with a
massless $\eta'$ particle (for all $N$) and for $N_f>1$ the first order
transition ends at $m=0$, where, depending on the value of $N_f$, the IR theory
has free Nambu-Goldstone bosons, an interacting conformal field theory, or a
free gauge theory. Even when the $4d$ bulk is smooth, domain walls and
interfaces can have interesting phase transitions separating different $3d$
phases. These turn out to be the phases of the recently studied $3d$
Chern-Simons matter theories, thus relating the dynamics of QCD$_4$ and
QCD$_3$, and, in particular, making contact with the recently discussed
dualities in 2+1 dimensions. For example, when the massless $4d$ theory has an
$SU(N_f)$ sigma model, the domain wall theory at low (nonzero) mass supports a
$3d$ massless $CP^{N_f-1}$ nonlinear $\sigma$-model with a Wess-Zumino term, in
agreement with the conjectured dynamics in 2+1 dimensions.

single and multiple vortex ring states that can arise in Bose-Einstein
condensates. Earlier works have illustrated the bifurcation of such states, in
the vicinity of the linear limit, for isotropic or anisotropic
three-dimensional harmonic traps. Here, we extend these states to the regime of

properties such as equilibrium radii and inter-ring distance, for multi-ring
states, as well as their vibrational spectra and possible instabilities. In
this limit, both the existence and stability characteristics can be partially
traced to a particle picture that considers the rings as individual particles
oscillating within the trap and interacting pairwise with one another. Finally,
we examine some representative instability scenarios of the multi-ring dynamics

neither phonons nor rotons provide a significant contribution to the drag
exerted on an ion moving within the superfluid. By using the Gross-Clark model,
in which a Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the superfluid wavefunction is coupled
to a SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation for the electron wavefunction, we study how
vortex nucleation affects the measured drift velocity of the ion. We use
parameters that give realistic values of the ratio of the radius of the bubble
with respect to the healing length in superfluid $^4$He at a pressure of one
bar. By performing fully 3D spatio-temporal simulations of the superfluid
coupled to an electron, that is modelled within an adiabatic approximation and
moving under the influence of an applied electric field, we are able to recover
the key dynamics of the ion-vortex interactions that arise and the subsequent
ion-vortex complexes that can form. Using the numerically computed drift
velocity of the ion as a function of the applied electric field, we determine
the vortex-nucleation limited mobility of the ion to recover values in
reasonable agreement with measured data.

Their light curves show increasing and decreasing patterns. New radio
observations at high angular resolution are also presented for two sources.
Among these is IRAS 18062+2410, whose radio structure is compared to
near-infrared images available in the literature. With these new maps, we can
estimate inner and outer radii of 0.03$""$ and 0.08$""$ for the ionised shell, an
ionised mass of $3.2\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$, and a density at the inner radius
of $7.7\times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, obtained by modelling the radio shell with
the new morphological constraints. The combination of multi-frequency data and,
where available, spectral-index maps leads to the detection of spectral indices
not due to thermal emission, contrary to what one would expect in planetary
nebulae. Our results allow us to hypothesise the existence of a link between
radio variability and non-thermal emission mechanisms in the nebulae. This link
seems to hold for IRAS 22568+6141 and may generally hold for those nebulae
where the radio flux decreases over time.

approximate factor model. Our statistics are based on a well-known property of
the $% \left( r+1\right) $-th eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix of the
data (having defined $r$ as the number of common factors): whilst under the
null the $\left( r+1\right) $-th eigenvalue is bounded, under the alternative
of a change (either in the loadings, or in the number of factors itself) it
becomes spiked. Given that the sample eigenvalue cannot be estimated
consistently under the null, we regularise the problem by randomising the test
statistic in conjunction with sample conditioning, obtaining a sequence of
\textit{i.i.d.}, asymptotically chi-square statistics which are then employed
to build the monitoring scheme. Numerical evidence shows that our procedure
works very well in finite samples, with a very small probability of false
detections and tight detection times in presence of a genuine change-point.

However, the nature of this coupling depends extremely sensitively on the

we show how plasmon strong coupling can be achieved in compact robust

strong coupling is impossible with monolayers due to the large exciton
coherence size, but resolve clear anti-crossings for 8 layer devices with Rabi

of handover in the proposed algorithm, various parameters such as the received
Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) at the user equipment (UE),
users access conditions to the phantom cells, and users staying time in the
target cell based on its velocity, has been considered. Theoretical analyses
and simulation results show that applying the suggested algorithm the improved
phantom cell structure has a much better performance than conventional HetNets
in terms of the number of handover.

420,Bayesian Joint Topic Modelling for Weakly Supervised Object Localisation,"  We address the problem of localisation of objects as bounding boxes in images
with weak labels. This weakly supervised object localisation problem has been
tackled in the past using discriminative models where each object class is
localised independently from other classes. We propose a novel framework based
on Bayesian joint topic modelling. Our framework has three distinctive
advantages over previous works: (1) All object classes and image backgrounds
are modelled jointly together in a single generative model so that ""explaining
away"" inference can resolve ambiguity and lead to better learning and
localisation. (2) The Bayesian formulation of the model enables easy
integration of prior knowledge about object appearance to compensate for
limited supervision. (3) Our model can be learned with a mixture of weakly
labelled and unlabelled data, allowing the large volume of unlabelled images on
the Internet to be exploited for learning. Extensive experiments on the
challenging VOC dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art competitors.

421,Psychological model of the investor and manager behavior in risk,"  All people have to make risky decisions in everyday life. And we do not know
how true they are. But is it possible to mathematically assess the correctness
of our choice? This article discusses the model of decision making under risk
on the example of project management. This is a game with two players, one of
which is Investor, and the other is the Project Manager. Each player makes a
risky decision for himself, based on his past experience. With the help of a
mathematical model, the players form a level of confidence, depending on who
the player accepts the strategy or does not accept. The project manager
assesses the costs and compares them with the level of confidence. An investor
evaluates past results. Also visit the case where the strategy of the player
accepts the part.

422,Constraints on Super-Earths Interiors from Stellar Abundances,"  Modeling the interior of exoplanets is essential to go further than the
conclusions provided by mean density measurements. In addition to the still
limited precision on the planets' fundamental parameters, models are limited by
the existence of degeneracies on their compositions. Here we present a model of
internal structure dedicated to the study of solid planets up to ~10 Earth
masses, i.e. Super-Earths. When the measurement is available, the assumption
that the bulk Fe/Si ratio of a planet is similar to that of its host star
allows us to significantly reduce the existing degeneracy and more precisely
constrain the planet's composition. Based on our model, we provide an update of
the mass-radius relationships used to provide a first estimate of a planet's
composition from density measurements. Our model is also applied to the cases
of two well-known exoplanets, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, using their recently
updated parameters. The core mass fractions of CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b are
found to lie within the 10-37% and 10-33% ranges, respectively, allowing both
planets to be compatible with an Earth-like composition. We also extend the
recent study of Proxima Centauri b, and show that its radius may reach 1.94
Earth radii in the case of a 5 Earth masses planet, as there is a 96.7%
probability that the real mass of Proxima Centauri b is below this value.

Center (ASC) software FX correlator that is an important component of
space-ground interferometer for Radioastron project. This project performs
joint observations of compact radio sources using 10 meter space radio
telescope (SRT) together with ground radio telescopes at 92, 18, 6 and 1.3 cm
wavelengths. In this paper we describe the main features of space-ground VLBI
data processing of Radioastron project using ASC correlator. Quality of
implemented fringe search procedure provides positive results without
significant losses in correlated amplitude. ASC Correlator has a computational
power close to real time operation. The correlator has a number of processing
modes: ""Continuum"", ""Spectral Line"", ""Pulsars"", ""Giant Pulses"",""Coherent"".
Special attention is paid to peculiarities of Radioastron space-ground VLBI
data processing. The algorithms of time delay and delay rate calculation are
also discussed, which is a matter of principle for data correlation of
space-ground interferometers. During 5 years of Radioastron space radio
telescope (SRT) successful operation, ASC correlator showed high potential of
satisfying steady growing needs of current and future ground and space VLBI
science. Results of ASC software correlator operation are demonstrated.

424,On the self-duality of rings of integers in tame and abelian extensions,"  Let $L/K$ be a tame and Galois extension of number fields with group $G$. It
is well-known that any ambiguous ideal in $L$ is locally free over
$\mathcal{O}_KG$ (of rank one), and so it defines a class in the locally free
class group of $\mathcal{O}_KG$, where $\mathcal{O}_K$ denotes the ring of
integers of $K$. In this paper, we shall study the relationship among the
classes arising from the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_L$ of $L$, the inverse
different $\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}^{-1}$ of $L/K$, and the square root of the
inverse different $A_{L/K}$ of $L/K$ (if it exists), in the case that $G$ is
abelian. They are naturally related because $A_{L/K}^2 =
\mathfrak{D}_{L/K}^{-1} = \mathcal{O}_L^*$, and $A_{L/K}$ is special because
$A_{L/K} = A_{L/K}^*$, where $*$ denotes dual with respect to the trace of
$L/K$.

425,Forecasting Transformative AI: An Expert Survey,"  Transformative AI technologies have the potential to reshape critical aspects
of society in the near future. However, in order to properly prepare policy
initiatives for the arrival of such technologies accurate forecasts and
timelines are necessary. A survey was administered to attendees of three AI
conferences during the summer of 2018 (ICML, IJCAI and the HLAI conference).
The survey included questions for estimating AI capabilities over the next
decade, questions for forecasting five scenarios of transformative AI and
questions concerning the impact of computational resources in AI research.
Respondents indicated a median of 21.5% of human tasks (i.e., all tasks that
humans are currently paid to do) can be feasibly automated now, and that this
figure would rise to 40% in 5 years and 60% in 10 years. Median forecasts
indicated a 50% probability of AI systems being capable of automating 90% of
current human tasks in 25 years and 99% of current human tasks in 50 years. The
conference of attendance was found to have a statistically significant impact
on all forecasts, with attendees of HLAI providing more optimistic timelines
with less uncertainty. These findings suggest that AI experts expect major
advances in AI technology to continue over the next decade to a degree that
will likely have profound transformative impacts on society.

427,Approximately certifying the restricted isometry property is hard,"  A matrix is said to possess the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) if it acts
as an approximate isometry when restricted to sparse vectors. Previous work has
shown it to be NP-hard to determine whether a matrix possess this property, but
only in a narrow range of parameters. In this work, we show that it is NP-hard
to make this determination for any accuracy parameter, even when we restrict
ourselves to instances which are either RIP or far from being RIP. This result
implies that it is NP-hard to approximate the range of parameters for which a
matrix possesses the Restricted Isometry Property with accuracy better than
some constant. Ours is the first work to prove such a claim without any
additional assumptions.

are studied by considering elastic tunneling through a single quantum dot.
Facilitated by the three-terminal geometry, the nanodevice is able to generate
simultaneously two electrical powers by utilizing only one temperature bias.
These two electrical powers can add up constructively or destructively,
depending on their signs. It is demonstrated that the constructive addition
leads to the enhancement of both energy efficiency and output power for various
system parameters. In fact, such enhancement, dubbed as thermoelectric
cooperative effect, can lead to maximum efficiency and power no less than when
only one of the electrical power is harvested.

430,DeepSaucer: Unified Environment for Verifying Deep Neural Networks,"  In recent years, a number of methods for verifying DNNs have been developed.
Because the approaches of the methods differ and have their own limitations, we
think that a number of verification methods should be applied to a developed
DNN. To apply a number of methods to the DNN, it is necessary to translate
either the implementation of the DNN or the verification method so that one
runs in the same environment as the other. Since those translations are
time-consuming, a utility tool, named DeepSaucer, which helps to retain and
reuse implementations of DNNs, verification methods, and their environments, is
proposed. In DeepSaucer, code snippets of loading DNNs, running verification
methods, and creating their environments are retained and reused as software
assets in order to reduce cost of verifying DNNs. The feasibility of DeepSaucer
is confirmed by implementing it on the basis of Anaconda, which provides
virtual environment for loading a DNN and running a verification method. In
addition, the effectiveness of DeepSaucer is demonstrated by usecase examples.

state-selective fluorescence imaging and achieves detection fidelities $>$98%
within 10$\,$ms, while keeping 99% of the atoms trapped. For the read-out of
dense arrays of neutral atoms in optical lattices, where the fluorescence

using Bayesian inference to determine the internal state of multiple atoms. Our
method is scalable to large neutral atom registers relevant for future quantum
information processing tasks requiring fast and non-destructive readout and can
also be used for the simultaneous read-out of quantum information stored in
internal qubit states and in the atoms' positions.

long signal segments and estimates the azimuthal directions of a sound source
through a binaurally trained classifier. This directional information of a
sound source could be e.g. used to steer the beamformer in a hearing aid to the
source of interest in order to increase the SNR. We evaluated our approach on
the development set of the IEEE-AASP Challenge on sound source localization and

434,Dynamic Shrinkage Processes,"  We propose a novel class of dynamic shrinkage processes for Bayesian time
series and regression analysis. Building upon a global-local framework of prior
construction, in which continuous scale mixtures of Gaussian distributions are
employed for both desirable shrinkage properties and computational
tractability, we model dependence among the local scale parameters. The
resulting processes inherit the desirable shrinkage behavior of popular
global-local priors, such as the horseshoe prior, but provide additional
localized adaptivity, which is important for modeling time series data or
regression functions with local features. We construct a computationally
efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm based on a PÃƒÂ³lya-Gamma scale mixture
representation of the proposed process. Using dynamic shrinkage processes, we
develop a Bayesian trend filtering model that produces more accurate estimates
and tighter posterior credible intervals than competing methods, and apply the
model for irregular curve-fitting of minute-by-minute Twitter CPU usage data.
In addition, we develop an adaptive time-varying parameter regression model to
assess the efficacy of the Fama-French five-factor asset pricing model with
momentum added as a sixth factor. Our dynamic analysis of manufacturing and
healthcare industry data shows that with the exception of the market risk, no
other risk factors are significant except for brief periods.

435,A Multiple Source Framework for the Identification of Activities of Daily Living Based on Mobile Device Data,"  The monitoring of the lifestyles may be performed based on a system for the
recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and their environments,
combining the results obtained with the user agenda. The system may be
developed with the use of the off-the-shelf mobile devices commonly used,
because they have several types of sensors available, including motion,
magnetic, acoustic, and location sensors. Data acquisition, data processing,
data fusion, and artificial intelligence methods are applied in different
stages of the system developed, which recognizes the ADL with pattern
recognition methods. The motion and magnetic sensors allow the recognition of
activities with movement, but the acoustic sensors allow the recognition of the
environments. The fusion of the motion, magnetic and acoustic sensors allows
the differentiation of other ADL. On the other hand, the location sensors
allows the recognition of ADL with large movement, and the combination of these
sensors with the other sensors increases the number of ADL recognized by the
system. This study consists on the comparison of different types of ANN for
choosing the best methods for the recognition of several ADL, which they are
implemented in a system for the recognition of ADL that combines the sensors
data with the users agenda for the monitoring of the lifestyles. Conclusions
point to the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with normalized data for the
identification of ADL with 85.89% of accuracy, the use of Feedforward neural
networks with non-normalized data for the identification of the environments
with 86.50% of accuracy, and the use of DNN with normalized data for the
identification of standing activities with 100% of accuracy, proving the
reliability of the framework presented in this study.

436,A Framework for Relating the Structures and Recovery Statistics in Pressure Time-Series Surveys for Dust Devils,"  Dust devils are likely the dominant source of dust for the martian
atmosphere, but the amount and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the
statistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure
perturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as
a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several
surveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil
structures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such
surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil
properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with
the widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be
distorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such
surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure
time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series
cannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical
and geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of
the duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a
distribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the
underlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a
scheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey
using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil
occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our
results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five
low-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.

438,Optimal Envelope Approximation in Fourier Basis with Applications in TV White Space,"  Lowpass envelope approximation of smooth continuous-variable signals are
introduced in this work. Envelope approximations are necessary when a given
signal has to be approximated always to a larger value (such as in TV white
space protection regions). In this work, a near-optimal approximate algorithm
for finding a signal's envelope, while minimizing a mean-squared cost function,
is detailed. The sparse (lowpass) signal approximation is obtained in the
linear Fourier series basis. This approximate algorithm works by discretizing
the envelope property from an infinite number of points to a large (but finite)
number of points. It is shown that this approximate algorithm is near-optimal
and can be solved by using efficient convex optimization programs available in
the literature. Simulation results are provided towards the end to gain more
insights into the analytical results presented.

external sources. In general, the spectrum consists of the eigenvalue 0 with
infinite multiplicity and further real discrete eigenvalues of finite

Kanemitsu, Tanigawa and Yoshimoto can be found on page $332$ of Ramanujan's
Lost Notebook in a slightly more general form. We extend an important
transformation of this series obtained by Kanemitsu, Tanigawa and Yoshimoto by
removing restrictions on the parameters $N$ and $h$ that they impose. From our
extension we deduce a beautiful new generalization of Ramanujan's famous
formula for odd zeta values which, for $N$ odd and $m>0$, gives a relation
between $\zeta(2m+1)$ and $\zeta(2Nm+1)$. A result complementary to the
aforementioned generalization is obtained for any even $N$ and
$m\in\mathbb{Z}$. It generalizes a transformation of Wigert and can be regarded
as a formula for $\zeta\left(2m+1-\frac{1}{N}\right)$. Applications of these
transformations include a generalization of the transformation for the
logarithm of Dedekind eta-function $\eta(z)$, Zudilin- and Rivoal-type results
on transcendence of certain values, and a transcendence criterion for Euler's

441,Towards a Service-oriented Platform for Intelligent Apps in Intermediate Cities,"  Smart cities are a growing trend in many cities in Argentina. In particular,
the so-called intermediate cities present a context and requirements different

442,Bistable reaction equations with doubly nonlinear diffusion,"  Reaction-diffusion equations appear in biology and chemistry, and combine
linear diffusion with different kind of reaction terms. Some of them are
remarkable from the mathematical point of view, since they admit families of
travelling waves that describe the asymptotic behaviour of a larger class of
solutions $0\leq u(x,t)\leq 1$ of the problem posed in the real line. We
investigate here the existence of waves with constant propagation speed, when
the linear diffusion is replaced by the ""slow"" doubly nonlinear diffusion. In
the present setting we consider bistable reaction terms, which present
interesting differences w.r.t. the Fisher-KPP framework recently studied in
\cite{AA-JLV:art}. We find different families of travelling waves that are
employed to describe the wave propagation of more general solutions and to
study the stability/instability of the steady states, even when we extend the
study to several space dimensions. A similar study is performed in the critical
case that we call ""pseudo-linear"", i.e., when the operator is still nonlinear
but has homogeneity one. With respect to the classical model and the
""pseudo-linear"" case, the travelling waves of the ""slow"" diffusion setting
exhibit free boundaries. \\ Finally, as a complement of \cite{AA-JLV:art}, we
study the asymptotic behaviour of more general solutions in the presence of a
""heterozygote superior"" reaction function and doubly nonlinear diffusion
(""slow"" and ""pseudo-linear"").

plan evasive maneuvers in real-time. In this paper, we present a new efficient
method for environmental free space detection with laser scanner based on 2D
occupancy grid maps (OGM) to be used for Advanced Driving Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS). Firstly, we introduce an enhanced
inverse sensor model tailored for high-resolution laser scanners for building
OGM. It compensates the unreflected beams and deals with the ray casting to
grid cells accuracy and computational effort problems. Secondly, we introduce
the 'vehicle on a circle for grid maps' map alignment algorithm that allows
building more accurate local maps by avoiding the computationally expensive
inaccurate operations of image sub-pixel shifting and rotation. The resulted
grid map is more convenient for ADAS features than existing methods, as it
allows using less memory sizes, and hence, results into a better real-time
performance. Thirdly, we present an algorithm to detect what we call the
'in-sight edges'. These edges guarantee modeling the free space area with a
single polygon of a fixed number of vertices regardless the driving situation
and map complexity. The results from real world experiments show the
effectiveness of our approach.

of computing tasks in fog networks is studied under latency and reliability
constraints. In the proposed scenario, computing can be executed either locally
at the user device or offloaded to an edge cloudlet. Moreover, cloudlets
exploit both their computing and storage capabilities by proactively caching
popular task computation results to minimize computing latency. To this end, a
clustering method to group spatially proximate user devices with mutual task
popularity interests and their serving cloudlets is proposed. Then, cloudlets
can proactively cache the popular tasks' computations of their cluster members
to minimize computing latency. Additionally, the problem of distributing tasks
to cloudlets is formulated as a matching game in which a cost function of
computing delay is minimized under latency and reliability constraints.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme guarantees reliable
computations with bounded latency and achieves up to 91% decrease in computing
latency as compared to baseline schemes.

445,Deuterium fractionation and H2D+ evolution in turbulent and magnetized cloud cores,"  High-mass stars are expected to form from dense prestellar cores. Their
precise formation conditions are widely discussed, including their virial
condition, which results in slow collapse for super-virial cores with strong
support by turbulence or magnetic fields, or fast collapse for sub-virial
sources. To disentangle their formation processes, measurements of the
deuterium fractions are frequently employed to approximately estimate the ages
of these cores and to obtain constraints on their dynamical evolution. We here
present 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including for the first time an
accurate non-equilibrium chemical network with 21 gas-phase species plus dust
grains and 213 reactions. With this network we model the deuteration process in
fully depleted prestellar cores in great detail and determine its response to
variations in the initial conditions. We explore the dependence on the initial
gas column density, the turbulent Mach number, the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio
and the distribution of the magnetic field, as well as the initial
ortho-to-para ratio of H2. We find excellent agreement with recent observations
of deuterium fractions in quiescent sources. Our results show that deuteration
is rather efficient, even when assuming a conservative ortho-to-para ratio of 3
and highly sub-virial initial conditions, leading to large deuterium fractions
already within roughly a free-fall time. We discuss the implications of our
results and give an outlook to relevant future investigations.

velocity observations revealed the existence of an Earth-mass planet around it.
With an orbital period of ~11 days, the surface of Proxima Centauri b is
temperate and might be habitable. We took a photometric monitoring campaign to
search for its transit, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan
Station in Antarctica. A transit-like signal appearing on 2016 September 8th,
is identified tentatively. Its midtime, $T_{C}=2,457,640.1990\pm0.0017$ HJD, is
consistent with the predicted ephemeris based on RV orbit in a 1$\sigma$
confidence interval. Time-correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of
Proxima Centauri, affecting detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a
Gaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of potential
transit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here, has a confidence
level of $2.5\sigma$. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to
confirm the planetary transit of Proxima Centauri b. We plan to monitor Proxima
Centauri in next Polar night at Dome A in Antarctica, taking the advantage of
continuous darkness. \citet{Kipping17} reported two tentative transit-like
signals of Proxima Centauri b, observed by the Microvariability and Oscillation
of Stars space Telescope in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The midtransit time of
our detection is 138 minutes later than that predicted by their transit
ephemeris. If all the signals are real transits, the misalignment of the epochs
plausibly suggests transit timing variations of Proxima Centauri b induced by
an outer planet in this system.

This reduced set of reactions is then employed to construct a reduced chemical

The problem of identifying influential reactions is first formulated as a

monovalent organic ion, B$^{2+}$ = non-Pb divalent metal, B$^+$ = monovalent
metal, B$^{3+}$ = trivalent metal, X = halogen). We show that, if B$^{2+}$ is
not Sn or Ge, Pb-free metal halide perovskites exhibit poor optical absorptions
because of their indirect bandgap nature. Among the nine possible types of
Pb-free metal halide double perovskites, six have direct bandgaps. Of these six
types, four show inversion symmetry-induced parity-forbidden or weak
transitions between band edges, making them not ideal for thin-film solar cell
application. Only one type of Pb-free double perovskite shows optical
absorption and electronic properties suitable for solar cell applications,
namely those with B$^+$ = In, Tl and B$^{3+}$ = Sb, Bi. Our results provide
important insights for designing new metal halide perovskites and double

449,Identification of microRNA clusters cooperatively acting on Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"  MicroRNAs play important roles in many biological processes. Their aberrant
expression can have oncogenic or tumor suppressor function directly
participating to carcinogenesis, malignant transformation, invasiveness and
metastasis. Indeed, miRNA profiles can distinguish not only between normal and
cancerous tissue but they can also successfully classify different subtypes of
a particular cancer. Here, we focus on a particular class of transcripts
encoding polycistronic miRNA genes that yields multiple miRNA components. We
describe clustered MiRNA Master Regulator Analysis (ClustMMRA), a fully
redesigned release of the MMRA computational pipeline (MiRNA Master Regulator
Analysis), developed to search for clustered miRNAs potentially driving cancer
molecular subtyping. Genomically clustered miRNAs are frequently co-expressed
to target different components of pro-tumorigenic signalling pathways. By
applying ClustMMRA to breast cancer patient data, we identified key miRNA
clusters driving the phenotype of different tumor subgroups. The pipeline was
applied to two independent breast cancer datasets, providing statistically
concordant results between the two analysis. We validated in cell lines the
miR-199/miR-214 as a novel cluster of miRNAs promoting the triple negative
subtype phenotype through its control of proliferation and EMT.

450,A Belief Propagation Algorithm for Multipath-Based SLAM,"  We present a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that is
based on radio signals and the association of specular multipath components
(MPCs) with geometric features. Especially in indoor scenarios, robust
localization from radio signals is challenging due to diffuse multipath
propagation, unknown MPC-feature association, and limited visibility of
features. In our approach, specular reflections at flat surfaces are described
in terms of virtual anchors (VAs) that are mirror images of the physical
anchors (PAs). The positions of these VAs and possibly also of the PAs are
unknown. We develop a Bayesian model of the SLAM problem including the unknown
MPC-VA/PA association. We represent this model by a factor graph, which enables
the use of the belief propagation (BP) scheme for efficient marginalization of
the joint posterior distribution. The resulting BP-based SLAM algorithm detects
the VAs associated with the PAs and estimates jointly the time-varying position
of the mobile agent and the positions of the VAs and possibly also of the PAs,
thereby leveraging the MPCs in the radio signal for improved accuracy and
robustness of agent localization. A core aspect of the algorithm is BP-based
probabilistic MPC-VA/PA association. Moreover, for improved initialization of
new VA positions, the states of unobserved potential VAs are modeled as a
random finite set and propagated in time by means of a ""zero-measurement""
probability hypothesis density filter. The proposed BP-based SLAM algorithm has
a low computational complexity and scales well in all relevant system
parameters. Experimental results using both synthetically generated
measurements and real ultra-wideband radio signals demonstrate the excellent
performance of the algorithm in challenging indoor environments.

451,Local methods for blocks of finite simple groups,"  This survey is about old and new results about the modular representation
theory of finite reductive groups with a strong emphasis on local methods. This
includes subpairs, Brauer's Main Theorems, fusion, Rickard equivalences. In the
defining characteristic we describe the relation between $p$-local subgroups
and parabolic subgroups, then give classical consequences on simple modules and
blocks, including the Alperin weight conjecture in that case. In the
non-defining characteristics, we sketch a picture of the local methods
pioneered by Fong-Srinivasan in the determination of blocks and their ordinary
characters. This includes the relationship with Lusztig's twisted induction and
the determination of defect groups. We conclude with a survey of the results
and methods by BonnafÃƒÂ©-Dat-Rouquier giving Morita equivalences between blocks
that preserve defect groups and the local structures.
The text grew out of the course and talks given by the author in July and
September 2016 during the program ""Local representation theory and simple
groups"" at CIB Lausanne. Written Oct 2017, to appear in a proceedings volume

452,Motion Planning for a Humanoid Mobile Manipulator System,"  A high redundant non-holonomic humanoid mobile dual-arm manipulator system is
presented in this paper where the motion planning to realize ""human-like""
autonomous navigation and manipulation tasks is studied. Firstly, an improved
MaxiMin NSGA-II algorithm, which optimizes five objective functions to solve
the problems of singularity, redundancy, and coupling between mobile base and
manipulator simultaneously, is proposed to design the optimal pose to
manipulate the target object. Then, in order to link the initial pose and that
optimal pose, an off-line motion planning algorithm is designed. In detail, an
efficient direct-connect bidirectional RRT and gradient descent algorithm is
proposed to reduce the sampled nodes largely, and a geometric optimization
method is proposed for path pruning. Besides, head forward behaviors are
realized by calculating the reasonable orientations and assigning them to the
mobile base to improve the quality of human-robot interaction. Thirdly, the
extension to on-line planning is done by introducing real-time sensing,
collision-test and control cycles to update robotic motion in dynamic
environments. Fourthly, an EEs' via-point-based multi-objective genetic
algorithm is proposed to design the ""human-like"" via-poses by optimizing four
objective functions. Finally, numerous simulations are presented to validate
the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.

453,A giant planet undergoing extreme ultraviolet irradiation by its hot massive-star host,"  The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet
depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of
extra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that
transit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to
transit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature
of ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is
itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat
differential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,
traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the
temperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the
molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of
ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be
significantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report
observations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbital
period ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host star
is at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the
KELT-9b's day-side temperature to be ~4600K. This is as hot as stars of stellar
type K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus the
primary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likely
atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme
ultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,
leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet
largely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host
star.

tremendously popular among young people and children in many countries. Most of
the digital services offered on the internet are advertising funded, which
makes advertising ubiquitous in children's everyday life. To understand the
impact of advertising-based digital services on children, we study the
collective behavior of users of YouTube for kids channels and present the

from 17 channels in US and UK and 24 channels in Brazil. The channels in
English have been viewed more than 37 billion times. We also collected more

and face recognition tools, we show the presence of racial and gender biases in
our large sample of users. We also identify children actively using YouTube,
although the minimum age for using the service is 13 years in most countries.
We provide comparisons of user behavior among the three countries, which
represent large user populations in the global North and the global South.

K_i(X, Z/n) = 0) provided that n is nilpotent on X (resp. is invertible on X).
Our descent and vanishing results apply more generally to certain Artin stacks
whose stabilizers are extensions of finite group schemes by group schemes of

456,Gravitational radiation from compact binary systems in screened modified gravity,"  Screened modified gravity (SMG) is a kind of scalar-tensor theory with
screening mechanisms, which can suppress the fifth force in dense regions and
allow theories to evade the solar system and laboratory tests. In this paper,
we investigate how the screening mechanisms in SMG affect the gravitational
radiation damping effects, calculate in detail the rate of the energy loss due
to the emission of tensor and scalar gravitational radiations, and derive their
contributions to the change in the orbital period of the binary system. We find
that the scalar radiation depends on the screened parameters and the
propagation speed of scalar waves, and the scalar dipole radiation dominates
the orbital decay of the binary system. For strongly self-gravitating bodies,
all effects of scalar sector are strongly suppressed by the screening
mechanisms in SMG. By comparing our results to observations of binary system
PSR J1738+0333, we place the stringent constraints on the screening mechanisms
in SMG. As an application of these results, we focus on three specific models
of SMG (chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton), and derive the constraints on the
model parameters, respectively.

457,weedNet: Dense Semantic Weed Classification Using Multispectral Images and MAV for Smart Farming,"  Selective weed treatment is a critical step in autonomous crop management as
related to crop health and yield. However, a key challenge is reliable, and
accurate weed detection to minimize damage to surrounding plants. In this
paper, we present an approach for dense semantic weed classification with
multispectral images collected by a micro aerial vehicle (MAV). We use the
recently developed encoder-decoder cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
Segnet, that infers dense semantic classes while allowing any number of input
image channels and class balancing with our sugar beet and weed datasets. To
obtain training datasets, we established an experimental field with varying
herbicide levels resulting in field plots containing only either crop or weed,
enabling us to use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a
distinguishable feature for automatic ground truth generation. We train 6
models with different numbers of input channels and condition (fine-tune) it to
achieve about 0.8 F1-score and 0.78 Area Under the Curve (AUC) classification
metrics. For model deployment, an embedded GPU system (Jetson TX2) is tested
for MAV integration. Dataset used in this paper is released to support the
community and future work.

459,A Generalized Framework for the Estimation of Causal Moderation Effects with Randomized Treatments and Non-Randomized Moderators,"  Researchers are often interested in analyzing conditional treatment effects.
One variant of this is ""causal moderation,"" which implies that intervention
upon a third (moderator) variable would alter the treatment effect. This study
presents a generalized, non-parametric framework for estimating causal
moderation effects given randomized treatments and non-randomized moderators
that achieves a number of goals. First, it highlights how conventional
approaches do not constitute unbiased or consistent estimators of causal
moderation effects. Second, it offers researchers a simple, transparent
approach for estimating causal moderation effects and lays out the assumptions
under which this can be performed consistently and/or without bias. Third, as
part of the estimation process, it allows researchers to implement their
preferred method of covariate adjustment, including parametric and
non-parametric methods, or alternative identification strategies of their
choosing. Fourth, it provides a set-up whereby sensitivity analysis designed
for the average-treatment-effect context can be extended to the moderation
context. An original application is also presented.

462,Semi-Analytical Perturbative Approaches to Third Body Resonant Trajectories,"  In the framework of multi-body dynamics, successive encounters with a third
body, even if well outside of its sphere of influence, can noticeably alter the
trajectory of a spacecraft. Examples of these effects have already been
exploited by past missions such as SMART-1, as well as are proposed to benefit
future missions to Jupiter, Saturn or Neptune, and disposal strategies from
Earth's High Eccentric or Libration Point Orbits. This paper revises three
totally different descriptions of the effects of the third body gravitational
perturbation. These are the averaged dynamics of the classical third body
perturbing function, the Opik's close encounter theory and the Keplerian map
approach. The first two techniques have respectively been applied to the cases
of a spacecraft either always remaining very far or occasionally experiencing
extremely close approaches to the third body. However, the paper also seeks
solutions for trajectories that undergo one or more close approaches at
distances in the order of the sphere of influence of the third body. The paper
attempts to gain insight into the accuracy of these different perturbative
techniques into each of these scenarios, as compared with the motion in the
Circular Restricted Three Body Problem.

directly outputs a probabilistic clustering of a batch of input examples in one
pass. It estimates a distribution over the number of clusters $k$, and for each
$1 \leq k \leq k_\mathrm{max}$, a distribution over the individual cluster
assignment for each data point. The network is trained in advance in a
supervised fashion on separate data to learn grouping by any perceptual
similarity criterion based on pairwise labels (same/different group). It can
then be applied to different data containing different groups. We demonstrate
promising performance on high-dimensional data like images (COIL-100) and
speech (TIMIT). We call this ``learning to cluster'' and show its conceptual
difference to deep metric learning, semi-supervise clustering and other related
approaches while having the advantage of performing learnable clustering fully

means of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. We report significant magnon

marking the departure of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ from the essentially isotropic

Bi1.95Sb0.05Se3 topological insulator (TI) is partially covered with a 100 nm
thick Niobium superconductor using DC magnetron sputtering by shadow masking
technique. The magnetotransport (MR) measurements have been performed
simultaneously on the TI sample with and without Nb top layer in the
temperature,T, range of 3 to 8 K, and a magnetic field B up to 15 T. MR on TI
region shows Subnikov de Haas oscillation at fields greater than 5 T. Anomalous
linear change in resistance is observed in the field range of negative 4T to
positive 4T at which Nb is superconducting. At 0 T field, the temperature
dependence of resistance on the Nb covered region revealed a superconducting
transition (TC) at 8.2 K, whereas TI area showed similar TC with the absence of
zero resistance states due to the additional resistance from superconductor
(SC) TI interface. Interestingly below the TC the R vs T measured on TI showed
an enhancement in resistance for positive field and prominent fall in
resistance for negative field direction. This indicates the directional
dependent scattering of the Cooper pairs on the surface of the TI due to the
superposition of spin singlet and triplet states in the superconductor and TI
respectively.

468,State-dependent Priority Scheduling for Networked Control Systems,"  Networked control systems (NCS) have attracted considerable attention in
recent years. While the stabilizability and optimal control of NCS for a given
communication system has already been studied extensively, the design of the
communication system for NCS has recently seen an increase in more thorough
investigation. In this paper, we address an optimal scheduling problem for a
set of NCS sharing a dedicated communication channel, providing performance
bounds and asymptotic stability. We derive a suboptimal scheduling policy with
dynamic state-based priorities calculated at the sensors, which are then used
for stateless priority queuing in the network, making it both scalable and
efficient to implement on routers or multi-layer switches. These properties are
beneficial towards leveraging existing IP networks for control, which will be a
crucial factor for the proliferation of wide-area NCS applications. By allowing
for an arbitrary number of concurrent transmissions, we are able to investigate
the relationship between available bandwidth, transmission rate, and delay. To
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide a proof-of-concept
implementation of the priority scheduler using real networking hardware.

Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (LR NURBS) is presented. LR NURBS can model
complex geometries exactly and are the rational extension of LR B-splines. The
local representation of the parameter space overcomes the drawback of
non-existent local refinement in standard NURBS-based isogeometric analysis.
For a convenient embedding into general finite element code, the BÃƒÂ©zier
extraction operator for LR NURBS is formulated. An automatic remeshing
technique is presented that allows adaptive local refinement and coarsening of
LR NURBS. In this work, LR NURBS are applied to contact computations of 3D
solids and membranes. For solids, LR NURBS-enriched finite elements are used to
discretize the contact surfaces with LR NURBS finite elements, while the rest
of the body is discretized by linear Lagrange finite elements. For membranes,
the entire surface is discretized by LR NURBS. Various numerical examples are
shown, and they demonstrate the benefit of using LR NURBS: Compared to uniform
refinement, LR NURBS can achieve high accuracy at lower computational cost.

471,"Approximate Program Smoothing Using Mean-Variance Statistics, with Application to Procedural Shader Bandlimiting","  This paper introduces a general method to approximate the convolution of an
arbitrary program with a Gaussian kernel. This process has the effect of
smoothing out a program. Our compiler framework models intermediate values in
the program as random variables, by using mean and variance statistics. Our
approach breaks the input program into parts and relates the statistics of the
different parts, under the smoothing process. We give several approximations
that can be used for the different parts of the program. These include the
approximation of Dorn et al., a novel adaptive Gaussian approximation, Monte
Carlo sampling, and compactly supported kernels. Our adaptive Gaussian
approximation is accurate up to the second order in the standard deviation of
the smoothing kernel, and mathematically smooth. We show how to construct a
compiler that applies chosen approximations to given parts of the input
program. Because each expression can have multiple approximation choices, we
use a genetic search to automatically select the best approximations. We apply
this framework to the problem of automatically bandlimiting procedural shader
programs. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex shaders, including
shaders with parallax mapping, animation, and spatially varying statistics. The
resulting smoothed shader programs outperform previous approaches both
numerically, and aesthetically, due to the smoothing properties of our
approximations.

large datasets, are used extensively in fields such as epidemiology,
meteorology, computational biology, and healthcare to understand phenomena, and
design high-stakes policies affecting everyday health and economy. For
instance, the OpenMalaria framework is a computationally-intensive simulation
used by various non-governmental and governmental agencies to understand
malarial disease spread and effectiveness of intervention strategies, and
subsequently design healthcare policies. Given that such shared results form
the basis of inferences drawn, technological solutions designed, and day-to-day
policies drafted, it is essential that the computations are validated and
trusted. In particular, in a multi-agent environment involving several
independent computing agents, a notion of trust in results generated by peers
is critical in facilitating transparency, accountability, and collaboration.
Using a novel combination of distributed validation of atomic computation
blocks and a blockchain-based immutable audits mechanism, this work proposes a
universal framework for distributed trust in computations. In particular we
address the scalaibility problem by reducing the storage and communication
costs using a lossy compression scheme. This framework guarantees not only
verifiability of final results, but also the validity of local computations,
and its cost-benefit tradeoffs are studied using a synthetic example of

474,Continuum of quantum fluctuations in a three-dimensional $S\!=\!1$ Heisenberg magnet,"  Conventional crystalline magnets are characterized by symmetry breaking and
normal modes of excitation called magnons with quantized angular momentum
$\hbar$. Neutron scattering correspondingly features extra magnetic Bragg
diffraction at low temperatures and dispersive inelastic scattering associated
with single magnon creation and annihilation. Exceptions are anticipated in
so-called quantum spin liquids as exemplified by the one-dimensional spin-1/2
chain which has no magnetic order and where magnons accordingly fractionalize
into spinons with angular momentum $\hbar/2$. This is spectacularly revealed by
a continuum of inelastic neutron scattering associated with two-spinon
processes and the absence of magnetic Bragg diffraction. Here, we report
evidence for these same key features of a quantum spin liquid in the
three-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$. Through specific
heat and neutron scattering measurements, Monte Carlo simulations, and analytic
approximations to the equal time correlations, we show that NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is
an almost ideal realization of the spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on
a pyrochlore lattice with weak connectivity and frustrated interactions.
Magnetic Bragg diffraction is absent and 90\% of the spectral weight forms a
continuum of magnetic scattering not dissimilar to that of the spin-1/2 chain
but with low energy pinch points indicating NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is in a Coulomb
phase. The residual entropy and diffuse elastic scattering points to an exotic
state of matter driven by frustration, quantum fluctuations and weak exchange
disorder.

476,Non-negative Matrix Factorization via Archetypal Analysis,"  Given a collection of data points, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
suggests to express them as convex combinations of a small set of `archetypes'
with non-negative entries. This decomposition is unique only if the true
archetypes are non-negative and sufficiently sparse (or the weights are
sufficiently sparse), a regime that is captured by the separability condition
and its generalizations.
In this paper, we study an approach to NMF that can be traced back to the
work of Cutler and Breiman (1994) and does not require the data to be
separable, while providing a generally unique decomposition. We optimize the
trade-off between two objectives: we minimize the distance of the data points
from the convex envelope of the archetypes (which can be interpreted as an
empirical risk), while minimizing the distance of the archetypes from the
convex envelope of the data (which can be interpreted as a data-dependent
regularization). The archetypal analysis method of (Cutler, Breiman, 1994) is
recovered as the limiting case in which the last term is given infinite weight.
We introduce a `uniqueness condition' on the data which is necessary for
exactly recovering the archetypes from noiseless data. We prove that, under
uniqueness (plus additional regularity conditions on the geometry of the
archetypes), our estimator is robust. While our approach requires solving a
non-convex optimization problem, we find that standard optimization methods
succeed in finding good solutions both for real and synthetic data.

477,Muon Reconstruction in the Daya Bay Water Pools,"  Muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools would serve to verify the
simulated muon fluxes and offer the possibility of studying cosmic muons in
general. This reconstruction is, however, complicated by many optical obstacles
and the small coverage of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as compared to other
large water Cherenkov detectors. The PMTs' timing information is useful only in
the case of direct, unreflected Cherenkov light. This requires PMTs to be added
and removed as an hypothesized muon trajectory is iteratively improved, to
account for the changing effects of obstacles and direction of light.
Therefore, muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools does not lend itself
to a general fitting procedure employing smoothly varying functions with
continuous derivatives. Here, an algorithm is described which overcomes these
complications. It employs the method of Least Mean Squares to determine an
hypothesized trajectory from the PMTs' charge-weighted positions. This
initially hypothesized trajectory is then iteratively refined using the PMTs'
timing information. Reconstructions with simulated data reproduce the simulated
trajectory to within about 5 degrees in direction and about 45 cm in position
at the pool surface, with a bias that tends to pull tracks away from the
vertical by about 3 degrees.

support vector machine (SVM) classifier using inertial data recorded by a
single foot-mounted sensor to differentiate between six motion types (walking,
jogging, running, sprinting, crouch-walking, and ladder-climbing) and report
mean test classification accuracy of over 90% on a dataset with five different
subjects. From these motion types, we select two of the most common (walking
and running), and describe a method to compute optimal zero-velocity detection
parameters tailored to both a specific user and motion type by maximizing the
detector F-score. By combining the motion classifier with a set of optimal
detection parameters, we show how we can reduce INS position error during mixed
walking and running motion. We evaluate our adaptive system on a total of 5.9
km of indoor pedestrian navigation performed by five different subjects moving
along a 130 m path with surveyed ground truth markers.

479,An Extended Low Fat Allocator API and Applications,"  The primary function of memory allocators is to allocate and deallocate
chunks of memory primarily through the malloc API. Many memory allocators also
implement other API extensions, such as deriving the size of an allocated
object from the object's pointer, or calculating the base address of an
allocation from an interior pointer. In this paper, we propose a general
purpose extended allocator API built around these common extensions. We argue
that such extended APIs have many applications and demonstrate several use
cases, such as (manual) memory error detection, meta data storage, typed
pointers and compact data-structures. Because most existing allocators were not
designed for the extended API, traditional implementations are expensive or not
possible.
Recently, the LowFat allocator for heap and stack objects has been developed.
The LowFat allocator is an implementation of the idea of low-fat pointers,
where object bounds information (size and base) are encoded into the native
machine pointer representation itself. The ""killer app"" for low-fat pointers is
automated bounds check instrumentation for program hardening and bug detection.
However, the LowFat allocator can also be used to implement highly optimized
version of the extended allocator API, which makes the new applications (listed
above) possible. In this paper, we implement and evaluate several applications
based efficient memory allocator API extensions using low-fat pointers. We also
extend the LowFat allocator to cover global objects for the first time.

480,A novel distribution-free hybrid regression model for manufacturing process efficiency improvement,"  This work is motivated by a particular problem of a modern paper
manufacturing industry, in which maximum efficiency of the fiber-filler
recovery process is desired. A lot of unwanted materials along with valuable
fibers and fillers come out as a by-product of the paper manufacturing process
and mostly goes as waste. The job of an efficient Krofta supracell is to
separate the unwanted materials from the valuable ones so that fibers and
fillers can be collected from the waste materials and reused in the
manufacturing process. The efficiency of Krofta depends on several crucial
process parameters and monitoring them is a difficult proposition. To solve
this problem, we propose a novel hybridization of regression trees (RT) and
artificial neural networks (ANN), hybrid RT-ANN model, to solve the problem of
low recovery percentage of the supracell. This model is used to achieve the
goal of improving supracell efficiency, viz., gain in percentage recovery. In
addition, theoretical results for the universal consistency of the proposed
model are given with the optimal value of a vital model parameter. Experimental
findings show that the proposed hybrid RT-ANN model achieves higher accuracy in
predicting Krofta recovery percentage than other conventional regression models
for solving the Krofta efficiency problem. This work will help the paper
manufacturing company to become environmentally friendly with minimal
ecological damage and improved waste recovery.

481,Exploring deep learning as an event classification method for the Cherenkov Telescope Array,"  Telescopes based on the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique (IACTs)
detect images of the atmospheric showers generated by gamma rays and cosmic
rays as they are absorbed by the atmosphere. The much more frequent cosmic-ray
events form the main background when looking for gamma-ray sources, and
therefore IACT sensitivity is significantly driven by the capability to
distinguish between these two types of events. Supervised learning algorithms,
like random forests and boosted decision trees, have been shown to effectively
classify IACT events. In this contribution we present results from exploratory
work using deep learning as an event classification method for the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA). CTA, conceived as an array of tens of IACTs, is an
international project for a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory,
aiming to improve on the sensitivity of current-generation experiments by an
order of magnitude and provide energy coverage from 20 GeV to more than 300
TeV.

482,Photo-Induced Bandgap Renormalization Governs the Ultrafast Response of Single-Layer MoS2,"  Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as promising
two-dimensional (2d) semiconductors for optoelectronic and flexible devices.
However, a microscopic explanation of their photophysics -- of pivotal
importance for the understanding and optimization of device operation -- is
still lacking. Here we use femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, with
pump pulse tunability and broadband probing, to monitor the relaxation dynamics
of single-layer MoS2 over the entire visible range, upon photoexcitation of
different excitonic transitions. We find that, irrespective of excitation
photon energy, the transient absorption spectrum shows the simultaneous
bleaching of all excitonic transitions and corresponding red-shifted
photoinduced absorption bands. First-principle modeling of the ultrafast
optical response reveals that a transient bandgap renormalization, caused by
the presence of photo-excited carriers, is primarily responsible for the
observed features. Our results demonstrate the strong impact of many-body
effects in the transient optical response of TMDs even in the
low-excitation-density regime.

483,Language Modeling by Clustering with Word Embeddings for Text Readability Assessment,"  We present a clustering-based language model using word embeddings for text
readability prediction. Presumably, an Euclidean semantic space hypothesis
holds true for word embeddings whose training is done by observing word
co-occurrences. We argue that clustering with word embeddings in the metric
space should yield feature representations in a higher semantic space
appropriate for text regression. Also, by representing features in terms of
histograms, our approach can naturally address documents of varying lengths. An
empirical evaluation using the Common Core Standards corpus reveals that the
features formed on our clustering-based language model significantly improve
the previously known results for the same corpus in readability prediction. We
also evaluate the task of sentence matching based on semantic relatedness using
the Wiki-SimpleWiki corpus and find that our features lead to superior matching
performance.

484,Far-field theory for trajectories of magnetic ellipsoids in rectangular and circular channels,"  We report a method to control the positions of ellipsoidal magnets in flowing
channels of rectangular or circular cross section at low Reynolds number.A
static uniform magnetic field is used to pin the particle orientation, and the
particles move with translational drift velocities resulting from hydrodynamic
interactions with the channel walls which can be described using Blake's image
tensor.Building on his insights, we are able to present a far-field theory
predicting the particle motion in rectangular channels, and validate the
accuracy of the theory by comparing to numerical solutions using the boundary
element method.We find that, by changing the direction of the applied magnetic
field, the motion can be controlled so that particles move either to a curved
focusing region or to the channel walls.We also use simulations to show that
the particles are focused to a single line in a circular channel.Our results
suggest ways to focus and segregate magnetic particles in lab-on-a-chip
devices.

485,On M-functions associated with modular forms,"  Let $f$ be a primitive cusp form of weight $k$ and level $N,$ let $\chi$ be a
Dirichlet character of conductor coprime with $N,$ and let
$\mathfrak{L}(f\otimes \chi, s)$ denote either $\log L(f\otimes \chi, s)$ or
$(L'/L)(f\otimes \chi, s).$ In this article we study the distribution of the
values of $\mathfrak{L}$ when either $\chi$ or $f$ vary. First, for a
quasi-character $\psi\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^\times$ we find the limit
for the average $\mathrm{Avg}\_\chi \psi(L(f\otimes\chi, s)),$ when $f$ is
fixed and $\chi$ varies through the set of characters with prime conductor that
tends to infinity. Second, we prove an equidistribution result for the values
of $\mathfrak{L}(f\otimes \chi,s)$ by establishing analytic properties of the
above limit function. Third, we study the limit of the harmonic average
$\mathrm{Avg}^h\_f \psi(L(f, s)),$ when $f$ runs through the set of primitive
cusp forms of given weight $k$ and level $N\to \infty.$ Most of the results are
obtained conditionally on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for
$L(f\otimes\chi, s).$

486,Slow and Long-ranged Dynamical Heterogeneities in Dissipative Fluids,"  A two-dimensional bidisperse granular fluid is shown to exhibit pronounced
long-ranged dynamical heterogeneities as dynamical arrest is approached. Here
we focus on the most direct approach to study these heterogeneities: we
identify clusters of slow particles and determine their size, $N_c$, and their
radius of gyration, $R_G$. We show that $N_c\propto R_G^{d_f}$, providing
direct evidence that the most immobile particles arrange in fractal objects
with a fractal dimension, $d_f$, that is observed to increase with packing
fraction $\phi$. The cluster size distribution obeys scaling, approaching an
algebraic decay in the limit of structural arrest, i.e., $\phi\to\phi_c$.
Alternatively, dynamical heterogeneities are analyzed via the four-point
structure factor $S_4(q,t)$ and the dynamical susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$.
$S_4(q,t)$ is shown to obey scaling in the full range of packing fractions,
$0.6\leq\phi\leq 0.805$, and to become increasingly long-ranged as
$\phi\to\phi_c$. Finite size scaling of $\chi_4(t)$ provides a consistency
check for the previously analyzed divergences of $\chi_4(t)\propto
(\phi-\phi_c)^{-\gamma_{\chi}}$ and the correlation length $\xi\propto
(\phi-\phi_c)^{-\gamma_{\xi}}$. We check the robustness of our results with
respect to our definition of mobility. The divergences and the scaling for
$\phi\to\phi_c$ suggest a non-equilibrium glass transition which seems
qualitatively independent of the coefficient of restitution.

487,A Globally Linearly Convergent Method for Pointwise Quadratically Supportable Convex-Concave Saddle Point Problems,"  We study the \emph{Proximal Alternating Predictor-Corrector} (PAPC) algorithm
introduced recently by Drori, Sabach and Teboulle to solve nonsmooth structured
convex-concave saddle point problems consisting of the sum of a smooth convex
function, a finite collection of nonsmooth convex functions and bilinear terms.
We introduce the notion of pointwise quadratic supportability, which is a
relaxation of a standard strong convexity assumption and allows us to show that
the primal sequence is R-linearly convergent to an optimal solution and the
primal-dual sequence is globally Q-linearly convergent. We illustrate the
proposed method on total variation denoising problems and on locally adaptive
estimation in signal/image deconvolution and denoising with multiresolution
statistical constraints.

488,Stability of casein micelles cross-linked with genipin: a physicochemical study as a function of pH,"  Chemical or enzymatic cross-linking of casein micelles (CMs) increases their
stability against dissociating agents. In this paper, a comparative study of
stability between native CMs and CMs cross-linked with genipin (CMs-GP) as a
function of pH is described. Stability to temperature and ethanol were
investigated in the pH range 2.0-7.0. The size and the charge
($\zeta$-potential) of the particles were determined by dynamic light
scattering. Native CMs precipitated below pH 5.5, CMs-GP precipitated from pH
3.5 to 4.5, whereas no precipitation was observed at pH 2.0-3.0 or pH 4.5-7.0.
The isoelectric point of CMs-GP was determined to be pH 3.7. Highest stability
against heat and ethanol was observed for CMs-GP at pH 2, where visible
coagulation was determined only after 800 s at 140 $^\circ$C or 87.5% (v/v) of
ethanol. These results confirmed the hypothesis that cross-linking by GP
increased the stability of CMs.

491,Triplet Network with Attention for Speaker Diarization,"  In automatic speech processing systems, speaker diarization is a crucial
front-end component to separate segments from different speakers. Inspired by
the recent success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in semantic inferencing,
triplet loss-based architectures have been successfully used for this problem.
However, existing work utilizes conventional i-vectors as the input
representation and builds simple fully connected networks for metric learning,
thus not fully leveraging the modeling power of DNN architectures. This paper
investigates the importance of learning effective representations from the
sequences directly in metric learning pipelines for speaker diarization. More
specifically, we propose to employ attention models to learn embeddings and the
metric jointly in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments are conducted on the
CALLHOME conversational speech corpus. The diarization results demonstrate
that, besides providing a unified model, the proposed approach achieves
improved performance when compared against existing approaches.

492,Dynamics of cracks in disordered materials,"  Predicting when rupture occurs or cracks progress is a major challenge in
numerous elds of industrial, societal and geophysical importance. It remains
largely unsolved: Stress enhancement at cracks and defects, indeed, makes the
macroscale dynamics extremely sensitive to the microscale material disorder.
This results in giant statistical uctuations and non-trivial behaviors upon
upscaling dicult to assess via the continuum approaches of engineering. These
issues are examined here. We will see: How linear elastic fracture mechanics
sidetracks the diculty by reducing the problem to that of the propagation of a
single crack in an eective material free of defects, How slow cracks sometimes
display jerky dynamics, with sudden violent events incompatible with the
previous approach, and how some paradigms of statistical physics can explain
it, How abnormally fast cracks sometimes emerge due to the formation of
microcracks at very small scales.

method for the image. The information bit is spreaded into middle-frequency
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of each block of an image using a
generated pseudo-random sequence. Unlike the conventional signal modeling, we
suppose that both signal and noise are distributed with Laplacian distribution
because the sample loss of digital media can be better modeled with this
distribution than the Gaussian one. We derive the optimum decoder for the
proposed embedding method thanks to the maximum likelihood decoding scheme. We
also analyze our watermarking system in the presence of noise and provide
analytical evaluations and several simulations. The results show that it has
the suitable performance and transparency required for watermarking
applications.

495,The Linear Point: A cleaner cosmological standard ruler,"  We show how a characteristic length scale imprinted in the galaxy two-point
correlation function, dubbed the ""linear point"", can serve as a comoving
cosmological standard ruler. In contrast to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
peak location, this scale is constant in redshift and is unaffected by
non-linear effects to within $0.5$ percent precision. We measure the location
of the linear point in the galaxy correlation function of the LOWZ and CMASS
samples from the Twelfth Data Release (DR12) of the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) collaboration. We combine our linear-point
measurement with cosmic-microwave-background constraints from the Planck
satellite to estimate the isotropic-volume distance $D_{V}(z)$, without relying
on a model-template or reconstruction method. We find $D_V(0.32)=1264\pm 28$
Mpc and $D_V(0.57)=2056\pm 22$ Mpc respectively, consistent with the quoted
values from the BOSS collaboration. This remarkable result suggests that all
the distance information contained in the baryon acoustic oscillations can be
conveniently compressed into the single length associated with the linear
point.

497,Stochastic Primal-Dual Method on Riemannian Manifolds with Bounded Sectional Curvature,"  We study a stochastic primal-dual method for constrained optimization over
Riemannian manifolds with bounded sectional curvature. We prove non-asymptotic
convergence to the optimal objective value. More precisely, for the class of
hyperbolic manifolds, we establish a convergence rate that is related to the
sectional curvature lower bound. To prove a convergence rate in terms of
sectional curvature for the elliptic manifolds, we leverage Toponogov's
comparison theorem. In addition, we provide convergence analysis for the
asymptotically elliptic manifolds, where the sectional curvature at each given
point on manifold is locally bounded from below by the distance function. We
demonstrate the performance of the primal-dual algorithm on the sphere for the
non-negative principle component analysis (PCA). In particular, under the
non-negativity constraint on the principle component and for the symmetric
spiked covariance model, we empirically show that the primal-dual approach
outperforms the spectral method. We also examine the performance of the
primal-dual method for the anchored synchronization from partial noisy
measurements of relative rotations on the Lie group SO(3). Lastly, we show that
the primal-dual algorithm can be applied to the weighted MAX-CUT problem under
constraints on the admissible cut. Specifically, we propose different
approximation algorithms for the weighted MAX-CUT problem based on optimizing a
function on the manifold of direct products of the unit spheres as well as the
manifold of direct products of the rotation groups.

498,Nudging the particle filter,"  We investigate a new sampling scheme aimed at improving the performance of
particle filters whenever (a) there is a significant mismatch between the
assumed model dynamics and the actual system, or (b) the posterior probability
tends to concentrate in relatively small regions of the state space. The
proposed scheme pushes some particles towards specific regions where the
likelihood is expected to be high, an operation known as nudging in the
geophysics literature. We re-interpret nudging in a form applicable to any
particle filtering scheme, as it does not involve any changes in the rest of
the algorithm. Since the particles are modified, but the importance weights do
not account for this modification, the use of nudging leads to additional bias
in the resulting estimators. However, we prove analytically that nudged
particle filters can still attain asymptotic convergence with the same error
rates as conventional particle methods. Simple analysis also yields an
alternative interpretation of the nudging operation that explains its
robustness to model errors. Finally, we show numerical results that illustrate
the improvements that can be attained using the proposed scheme. In particular,
we present nonlinear tracking examples with synthetic data and a model
inference example using real-world financial data.

associated with the 40 T pocket, which strongly supports the presence of
topological states in bulk BiPd and may result in topological superconductivity
due to the proximity coupling to other bands.

500,Unveiling ADP-binding sites and channels in respiratory complexes: Validation of Murburn concept as a holistic explanation for oxidative phosphorylation,"  Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mOxPhos) makes ATP, the energy
currency of life. Chemiosmosis, a proton centric mechanism, advocates that
Complex V harnesses a transmembrane potential (TMP) for ATP synthesis. This
perception of cellular respiration requires oxygen to stay tethered at Complex
IV (an association inhibited by cyanide) and diffusible reactive oxygen species
(DROS) are considered wasteful and toxic products. With new mechanistic
insights on heme and flavin enzymes, an oxygen or DROS centric explanation
(called murburn concept) was recently proposed for mOxPhos. In the new
mechanism, TMP is not directly harnessed, protons are a rate limiting reactant
and DROS within matrix serve as the chemical coupling agents that directly link
NADH oxidation with ATP synthesis. Herein, we report multiple ADP binding sites
and solvent accessible DROS channels in respiratory proteins, which validate
the oxygen or DROS centric power generation (ATP synthesis) system in mOxPhos.
Since cyanide's heme binding Kd is high (mM), low doses (uM) of cyanide is
lethal because cyanide disrupts DROS dynamics in mOxPhos. The critical study
also provides comprehensive arguments against Mitchell's and Boyer's
explanations and extensive support for murburn concept based holistic
perspectives for mOxPhos.

magnetization studies of the structural, magnetic and the superconducting
properties of the Ce-underdoped superconducting (SC) electron-doped cuprate
system T'-Pr_1.3-xLa_0.7Ce_xCuO_4 with x = 0.1 are reported. A strong reduction
of the lattice constants a and c is observed under pressure. However, no
indication of any pressure induced phase transition from T' to T structure is
observed up to the maximum applied pressure of p = 11 GPa. Large and non-linear
increase of the short-range magnetic order temperature T_so in
T'-Pr_1.3-xLa_0.7Ce_xCuO_4 (x = 0.1) was observed under pressure.
Simultaneously pressure causes a non-linear decrease of the SC transition
temperature T_c. All these experiments establish the short-range magnetic order
as an intrinsic and a new competing phase in SC T'-Pr_1.2La_0.7Ce_0.1CuO_4. The
observed pressure effects may be interpreted in terms of the improved nesting

503,Regrasping by Fixtureless Fixturing,"  This paper presents a fixturing strategy for regrasping that does not require
a physical fixture. To regrasp an object in a gripper, a robot pushes the
object against external contact/s in the environment such that the external
contact keeps the object stationary while the fingers slide over the object. We
call this manipulation technique fixtureless fixturing. Exploiting the
mechanics of pushing, we characterize a convex polyhedral set of pushes that
results in fixtureless fixturing. These pushes are robust against uncertainty
in the object inertia, grasping force, and the friction at the contacts. We
propose a sampling-based planner that uses the sets of robust pushes to rapidly
build a tree of reachable grasps. A path in this tree is a pushing strategy,
possibly involving pushes from different sides, to regrasp the object. We
demonstrate the experimental validity and robustness of the proposed
manipulation technique with different regrasp examples on a manipulation
platform. Such a fast and flexible regrasp planner facilitates versatile and
flexible automation solutions.

other state-of-the-art multi-label methods. Nonetheless, with increasing label

Subset LLDA, a simple variant of the standard LLDA algorithm, that not only can
effectively scale up to problems with hundreds of thousands of labels but also
improves over the LLDA state-of-the-art. We conduct extensive experiments on
eight data sets, with label sets sizes ranging from hundreds to hundreds of
thousands, comparing our proposed algorithm with the previously proposed LLDA
algorithms (Prior--LDA, Dep--LDA), as well as the state of the art in extreme
multi-label classification. The results show a steady advantage of our method
over the other LLDA algorithms and competitive results compared to the extreme

505,A Hybrid Approach to Video Source Identification,"  Multimedia Forensics allows to determine whether videos or images have been
captured with the same device, and thus, eventually, by the same person.
Currently, the most promising technology to achieve this task, exploits the
unique traces left by the camera sensor into the visual content. Anyway, image
and video source identification are still treated separately from one another.
This approach is limited and anachronistic if we consider that most of the
visual media are today acquired using smartphones, that capture both images and
videos. In this paper we overcome this limitation by exploring a new approach
that allows to synergistically exploit images and videos to study the device
from which they both come. Indeed, we prove it is possible to identify the
source of a digital video by exploiting a reference sensor pattern noise
generated from still images taken by the same device of the query video. The
proposed method provides comparable or even better performance, when compared
to the current video identification strategies, where a reference pattern is
estimated from video frames. We also show how this strategy can be effective
even in case of in-camera digitally stabilized videos, where a non-stabilized
reference is not available, by solving some state-of-the-art limitations. We
explore a possible direct application of this result, that is social media
profile linking, i.e. discovering relationships between two or more social
media profiles by comparing the visual contents - images or videos - shared
therein.

equilibria are the $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria of the game from which the data
was generated (true game), in $\mathcal{O}(m^4 d^4 \log (pd))$ samples of
strategy profiles --- where $m$ is the maximum number of pure strategies of a
player, $p$ is the number of players, and $d$ is the maximum degree of the game
graph. Under slightly more stringent separability conditions on the payoff
matrices of the true game, we show that our method learns a game with the exact
same Nash equilibria as the true game. We also show that $\Omega(d \log (pm))$
samples are necessary for any method to consistently recover a game, with the
same Nash-equilibria as the true game, from observations of strategic
interactions. We verify our theoretical results through simulation experiments.

law, exact periodic and solitonic solutions exist. Khare and Saxena

dual form of the Bellman optimality equation, which can be viewed as a
two-player game between the actor and a critic-like function, which is named as
dual critic. Compared to its actor-critic relatives, Dual-AC has the desired
property that the actor and dual critic are updated cooperatively to optimize
the same objective function, providing a more transparent way for learning the
critic that is directly related to the objective function of the actor. We then
provide a concrete algorithm that can effectively solve the minimax
optimization problem, using techniques of multi-step bootstrapping, path
regularization, and stochastic dual ascent algorithm. We demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performances across several

bipartite subgraphs of its complement. More precisely, we state the following.
Let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$ such that its complement has exactly
$a(G)$ subgraphs isomorphic to $K_{2p,2q}$ and exactly $b(G)$ subgraphs
isomorphic to $K_{2p+1,2q+1}$. Then $d(G) = 2^n -1 + 2[a(G)-b(G)]$. We also

achieving scalability in hierarchical $N$-Body algorithms like FMM. In the
present work, we propose four independent strategies to improve partitioning
and reduce communication. First of all, we show that the conventional wisdom of
using space-filling curve partitioning may not work well for boundary integral
problems, which constitute about 50% of FMM's application user base. We propose
an alternative method which modifies orthogonal recursive bisection to solve
the cell-partition misalignment that has kept it from scaling previously.
Secondly, we optimize the granularity of communication to find the optimal
balance between a bulk-synchronous collective communication of the local
essential tree and an RDMA per task per cell. Finally, we take the dynamic
sparse data exchange proposed by Hoefler et al. and extend it to a hierarchical
sparse data exchange, which is demonstrated at scale to be faster than the MPI

propose a novel automatic scene scale inference method. The method is based on
matching bounding boxes of rendered 3D models of vehicles with detected
bounding boxes in the image. The proposed method can be used from arbitrary
viewpoints, since it has no constraints on camera placement. We evaluate our
method on the recent comprehensive dataset for speed measurement BrnoCompSpeed.
Experiments show that our automatic camera calibration method by detection of
two vanishing points reduces error by 50% (mean distance ratio error reduced
from 0.18 to 0.09) compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. We also
show that our scene scale inference method is more precise, outperforming both
state-of-the-art automatic calibration method for speed measurement (error
reduction by 86% -- 7.98km/h to 1.10km/h) and manual calibration (error
reduction by 19% -- 1.35km/h to 1.10km/h). We also present qualitative results
of the proposed automatic camera calibration method on video sequences obtained
from real surveillance cameras in various places, and under different lighting
conditions (night, dawn, day).

512,Distance Measure Machines,"  This paper presents a distance-based discriminative framework for learning
with probability distributions. Instead of using kernel mean embeddings or
generalized radial basis kernels, we introduce embeddings based on
dissimilarity of distributions to some reference distributions denoted as
templates. Our framework extends the theory of similarity of Balcan et al.
(2008) to the population distribution case and we show that, for some learning
problems, some dissimilarity on distribution achieves low-error linear decision
functions with high probability. Our key result is to prove that the theory
also holds for empirical distributions. Algorithmically, the proposed approach
consists in computing a mapping based on pairwise dissimilarity where learning
a linear decision function is amenable. Our experimental results show that the
Wasserstein distance embedding performs better than kernel mean embeddings and
computing Wasserstein distance is far more tractable than estimating pairwise
Kullback-Leibler divergence of empirical distributions.

513,DSBGK Method to Incorporate the CLL Reflection Model and to Simulate Gas Mixtures,"  Molecular reflections on usual wall surfaces can be statistically described
by the Maxwell diffuse reflection model, which has been successfully applied in
the DSBGK simulations. We develop the DSBGK algorithm to implement the
Cercignani-Lampis-Lord (CLL) reflection model, which is widely applied to
polished surfaces and used particularly in modeling space shuttles to predict
the heat and force loads exerted by the high-speed flows around the surfaces.
We also extend the DSBGK method to simulate gas mixtures and high contrast of
number densities of different components can be handled at a cost of memory
usage much lower than that needed by the DSMC simulations because the average
numbers of simulated molecules of different components per cell can be equal in
the DSBGK simulations.

$(a,b,c,d)$ stand for $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ such that $ad-bc=1$.
Define \begin{equation} \label{eq_main} F(s) = \sum_{(a,b,c,d)} f(a,b,c,d)^s.

triangle inequality defects for the lattice parallelograms (in the first

We prove that $F(s)$ converges when $s>1/2$ and diverges at $s=1/2$. We also

515,Efficient sampling of conditioned Markov jump processes,"  We consider the task of generating draws from a Markov jump process (MJP)
between two time points at which the process is known. Resulting draws are
typically termed bridges and the generation of such bridges plays a key role in
simulation-based inference algorithms for MJPs. The problem is challenging due
to the intractability of the conditioned process, necessitating the use of
computationally intensive methods such as weighted resampling or Markov chain
Monte Carlo. An efficient implementation of such schemes requires an
approximation of the intractable conditioned hazard/propensity function that is
both cheap and accurate. In this paper, we review some existing approaches to
this problem before outlining our novel contribution. Essentially, we leverage
the tractability of a Gaussian approximation of the MJP and suggest a
computationally efficient implementation of the resulting conditioned hazard
approximation. We compare and contrast our approach with existing methods using
three examples.

516,Holography and thermalization in optical pump-probe spectroscopy,"  Using holography, we model experiments in which a 2+1D strange metal is
pumped by a laser pulse into a highly excited state, after which the time
evolution of the optical conductivity is probed. We consider a finite-density
state with mildly broken translation invariance and excite it by oscillating
electric field pulses. At zero density, the optical conductivity would assume
its thermalized value immediately after the pumping has ended. At finite
density, pulses with significant DC components give rise to slow exponential
relaxation, governed by a vector quasinormal mode. In contrast, for
high-frequency pulses the amplitude of the quasinormal mode is strongly
suppressed, so that the optical conductivity assumes its thermalized value
effectively instantaneously. This surprising prediction may provide a stimulus
for taking up the challenge to realize these experiments in the laboratory.
Such experiments would test a crucial open question faced by applied
holography: Are its predictions artefacts of the large $N$ limit or do they
enjoy sufficient UV independence to hold at least qualitatively in real-world
systems?

517,Representing Hybrid Automata by Action Language Modulo Theories,"  Both hybrid automata and action languages are formalisms for describing the
evolution of dynamic systems. This paper establishes a formal relationship
between them. We show how to succinctly represent hybrid automata in an action
language which in turn is defined as a high-level notation for answer set
programming modulo theories (ASPMT) --- an extension of answer set programs to
the first-order level similar to the way satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)
extends propositional satisfiability (SAT). We first show how to represent
linear hybrid automata with convex invariants by an action language modulo
theories. A further translation into SMT allows for computing them using SMT
solvers that support arithmetic over reals. Next, we extend the representation
to the general class of non-linear hybrid automata allowing even non-convex
invariants. We represent them by an action language modulo ODE (Ordinary
Differential Equations), which can be compiled into satisfiability modulo ODE.
We developed a prototype system cplus2aspmt based on these translations, which
allows for a succinct representation of hybrid transition systems that can be
computed effectively by the state-of-the-art SMT solver dReal.

518,An enthalpy-based multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for solid-liquid phase change heat transfer in metal foams,"  In this paper, an enthalpy-based multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice
Boltzmann (LB) method is developed for solid-liquid phase change heat transfer
in metal foams under local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) condition. The
enthalpy-based MRT-LB method consists of three different MRT-LB models: one for
flow field based on the generalized non-Darcy model, and the other two for
phase change material (PCM) and metal foam temperature fields described by the
LTNE model. The moving solid-liquid phase interface is implicitly tracked
through the liquid fraction, which is simultaneously obtained when the energy
equations of PCM and metal foam are solved. The present method has several
distinctive features. First, as compared with previous studies, the present
method avoids the iteration procedure, thus it retains the inherent merits of
the standard LB method and is superior over the iteration method in terms of
accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, a volumetric LB scheme instead
of the bounce-back scheme is employed to realize the no-slip velocity condition
in the interface and solid phase regions, which is consistent with the actual
situation. Last but not least, the MRT collision model is employed, and with
additional degrees of freedom, it has the ability to reduce the numerical
diffusion across phase interface induced by solid-liquid phase change.
Numerical tests demonstrate that the present method can be served as an
accurate and efficient numerical tool for studying metal foam enhanced
solid-liquid phase change heat transfer in latent heat storage. Finally,
comparisons and discussions are made to offer useful information for practical
applications of the present method.

present paper reports the formation of subaqueous barchan dunes from initially
conical heaps in a rectangular channel. Because the most unique feature of a
barchan dune is its horns, we associate the timescale for the appearance of
horns to the formation of a barchan dune. A granular heap initially conical was
placed on the bottom wall of a closed conduit and it was entrained by a water
flow in turbulent regime. After a certain time, horns appear and grow, until an
equilibrium length is reached. Our results show the existence of the timescales
$0.5t_c$ and $2.5t_c$ for the appearance and equilibrium of horns,
respectively, where $t_c$ is a characteristic time that scales with the grains
diameter, gravity acceleration, densities of the fluid and grains, and shear
and threshold velocities.

where the goal is to estimate an unknown nondecreasing regression function $f$
from independent pairs $(x_i, y_i)$ where $\mathbb{E}[y_i]=f(x_i), i=1, \ldots

computationally, much less is known about its uncoupled counterpart where one
is given only the unordered sets $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ and $\{y_1, \ldots,

minimax rates under weak moments conditions on $y_i$ and to give an efficient
algorithm achieving optimal rates. Both upper and lower bounds employ
moment-matching arguments that are also pertinent to learning mixtures of

521,Failure of Smooth Pasting Principle and Nonexistence of Equilibrium Stopping Rules under Time-Inconsistency,"  This paper considers a time-inconsistent stopping problem in which the
inconsistency arises from non-constant time preference rates. We show that the
smooth pasting principle, the main approach that has been used to construct
explicit solutions for conventional time-consistent optimal stopping problems,
may fail under time-inconsistency. Specifically, we prove that the smooth
pasting principle solves a time-inconsistent problem within the intra-personal
game theoretic framework if and only if a certain inequality on the model
primitives is satisfied. We show that the violation of this inequality can
happen even for very simple non-exponential discount functions. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the stopping problem does not admit any intra-personal
equilibrium whenever the smooth pasting principle fails. The ""negative"" results
in this paper caution blindly extending the classical approaches for
time-consistent stopping problems to their time-inconsistent counterparts.

522,Perils of Zero-Interaction Security in the Internet of Things,"  The Internet of Things (IoT) demands authentication systems which can provide
both security and usability. Recent research utilizes the rich sensing
capabilities of smart devices to build security schemes operating without human
interaction, such as zero-interaction pairing (ZIP) and zero-interaction
authentication (ZIA). Prior work proposed a number of ZIP and ZIA schemes and
reported promising results. However, those schemes were often evaluated under
conditions which do not reflect realistic IoT scenarios. In addition, drawing
any comparison among the existing schemes is impossible due to the lack of a
common public dataset and unavailability of scheme implementations.
In this paper, we address these challenges by conducting the first
large-scale comparative study of ZIP and ZIA schemes, carried out under
realistic conditions. We collect and release the most comprehensive dataset in
the domain to date, containing over 4250 hours of audio recordings and 1
billion sensor readings from three different scenarios, and evaluate five
state-of-the-art schemes based on these data. Our study reveals that the
effectiveness of the existing proposals is highly dependent on the scenario
they are used in. In particular, we show that these schemes are subject to
error rates between 0.6% and 52.8%.

efficient methods to study the physicochemical properties they may display. In
this regard, we develop a simulation strategy based on Molecular Dynamics (MD)
that addresses the geometric degrees of freedom of an auxetic two-dimensional
protein crystal. This model consists of a network of impenetrable rigid squares
linked through massless rigid rods, thus featuring a large number of both
holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. Our MD methodology is optimized to
study highly constrained systems and allows for the simulation of long-time
dynamics with reasonably large timesteps. The data extracted from the
simulations shows a persistent motional interdependence among the protein
subunits in the crystal. We characterize the dynamical correlations featured by
these subunits and identify two regimes characterized by their locality or
nonlocality, depending on the geometric parameters of the crystal. From the
same data, we also calculate the Poisson\rq{}s (longitudinal to axial strain)
ratio of the crystal, and learn that, due to holonomic constraints (rigidness
of the rod links), the crystal remains auxetic even after significant changes
in the original geometry. The nonholonomic ones (collisions between subunits)
increase the number of inhomogeneous deformations of the crystal, thus driving
it away from an isotropic response. Our work provides the first simulation of
the dynamics of protein crystals and offers insights into promising mechanical
properties afforded by these materials.

524,Core2Vec: A core-preserving feature learning framework for networks,"  Recent advances in the field of network representation learning are mostly
attributed to the application of the skip-gram model in the context of graphs.
State-of-the-art analogues of skip-gram model in graphs define a notion of
neighbourhood and aim to find the vector representation for a node, which
maximizes the likelihood of preserving this neighborhood.
In this paper, we take a drastic departure from the existing notion of
neighbourhood of a node by utilizing the idea of coreness. More specifically,
we utilize the well-established idea that nodes with similar core numbers play
equivalent roles in the network and hence induce a novel and an organic notion
of neighbourhood. Based on this idea, we propose core2vec, a new algorithmic
framework for learning low dimensional continuous feature mapping for a node.
Consequently, the nodes having similar core numbers are relatively closer in
the vector space that we learn.
We further demonstrate the effectiveness of core2vec by comparing word
similarity scores obtained by our method where the node representations are
drawn from standard word association graphs against scores computed by other
state-of-the-art network representation techniques like node2vec, DeepWalk and
LINE. Our results always outperform these existing methods

close to uniform in $O(n\log n)$ time, given a random (improper) start. This

526,Channel masking for multivariate time series shapelets,"  Time series shapelets are discriminative sub-sequences and their similarity
to time series can be used for time series classification. Initial shapelet
extraction algorithms searched shapelets by complete enumeration of all
possible data sub-sequences. Research on shapelets for univariate time series
proposed a mechanism called shapelet learning which parameterizes the shapelets
and learns them jointly with a prediction model in an optimization procedure.
Trivial extension of this method to multivariate time series does not yield
very good results due to the presence of noisy channels which lead to
overfitting. In this paper we propose a shapelet learning scheme for
multivariate time series in which we introduce channel masks to discount noisy
channels and serve as an implicit regularization.

527,Spin mediated enhanced negative magnetoresistance in Ni80Fe20 and p-silicon bilayer,"  In this work, we present an experimental study of spin mediated enhanced
negative magnetoresistance in Ni80Fe20 (50 nm)/p-Si (350 nm) bilayer. The
resistance measurement shows a reduction of ~2.5% for the bilayer specimen as
compared to 1.3% for Ni80Fe20 (50 nm) on oxide specimen for an out-of-plane
applied magnetic field of 3T. In the Ni80Fe20-only film, the negative
magnetoresistance behavior is attributed to anisotropic magnetoresistance. We
propose that spin polarization due to spin-Hall effect is the underlying cause
of the enhanced negative magnetoresistance observed in the bilayer. Silicon has
weak spin orbit coupling so spin Hall magnetoresistance measurement is not
feasible. We use V2{\omega} and V3{\omega} measurement as a function of
magnetic field and angular rotation of magnetic field in direction normal to
electric current to elucidate the spin-Hall effect. The angular rotation of
magnetic field shows a sinusoidal behavior for both V2{\omega} and V3{\omega},
which is attributed to the spin phonon interactions resulting from the
spin-Hall effect mediated spin polarization. We propose that the spin
polarization leads to a decrease in hole-phonon scattering resulting in
enhanced negative magnetoresistance.

for wireless powering or communication, or for both. The severely limited range
of an inductively coupled source-destination pair can be improved using
resonant relay devices, which are purely passive in nature. Utilization of such
magneto-inductive relays has only been studied for regular network topologies,
allowing simplified assumptions on the mutual antenna couplings. In this work
we present an analysis of magneto-inductive passive relaying in arbitrarily
arranged networks. We find that the resulting channel has characteristics
similar to multipath fading: the channel power gain is governed by a
non-coherent sum of phasors, resulting in increased frequency selectivity. We
propose and study two strategies to increase the channel power gain of random
relay networks: i) deactivation of individual relays by open-circuit switching
and ii) frequency tuning. The presented results show that both methods improve
the utilization of available passive relays, leading to reliable and
significant performance gains.

a $\delta$-interaction of strength $\alpha > 0$ supported on an unbounded
surface parametrized by the mapping $\mathbb{R}^2\ni x\mapsto (x,\beta f(x))$,
where $\beta \in [0,\infty)$ and $f\colon \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$,
$f\not\equiv 0$, is a $C^2$-smooth, compactly supported function. The surface
supporting the interaction can be viewed as a local deformation of the plane.
It is known that the essential spectrum of this SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger operator
coincides with $[-\frac14\alpha^2,+\infty)$. We prove that for all sufficiently
small $\beta > 0$ its discrete spectrum is non-empty and consists of a unique
simple eigenvalue. Moreover, we obtain an asymptotic expansion of this
eigenvalue in the limit $\beta \rightarrow 0+$. In particular, this eigenvalue
tends to $-\frac14\alpha^2$ exponentially fast as $\beta\rightarrow 0+$.

532,Inverse Kinematics for Control of Tensegrity Soft Robots: Existence and Optimality of Solutions,"  Tension-network (`tensegrity') robots encounter many control challenges as
articulated soft robots, due to the structures' high-dimensional nonlinear
dynamics. Control approaches have been developed which use the inverse
kinematics of tensegrity structures, either for open-loop control or as
equilibrium inputs for closed-loop controllers. However, current formulations
of the tensegrity inverse kinematics problem are limited in robotics
applications: first, they can lead to higher than needed cable tensions, and
second, may lack solutions when applied to robots with high node-to-cable
ratios. This work provides progress in both directions. To address the first
limitation, the objective function for the inverse kinematics optimization
problem is modified to produce cable tensions as low or lower than before, thus
reducing the load on the robots' motors. For the second, a reformulation of the
static equilibrium constraint is proposed, which produces solutions independent
of the number of nodes within each rigid body. Simulation results using the
second reformulation on a specific tensegrity spine robot show reasonable
open-loop control results, whereas the previous formulation could not produce
any solution.

533,Development of probabilistic dam breach model using Bayesian inference,"  Dam breach models are commonly used to predict outflow hydrographs of
potentially failing dams and are key ingredients for evaluating flood risk. In
this paper a new dam breach modeling framework is introduced that shall improve
the reliability of hydrograph predictions of homogeneous earthen embankment
dams. Striving for a small number of parameters, the simplified physics-based
model describes the processes of failing embankment dams by breach enlargement,
driven by progressive surface erosion. Therein the erosion rate of dam material
is modeled by empirical sediment transport formulations. Embedding the model
into a Bayesian multilevel framework allows for quantitative analysis of
different categories of uncertainties. To this end, data available in
literature of observed peak discharge and final breach width of historical dam
failures was used to perform model inversion by applying Markov Chain Monte
Carlo simulation. Prior knowledge is mainly based on non-informative
distribution functions. The resulting posterior distribution shows that the
main source of uncertainty is a correlated subset of parameters, consisting of
the residual error term and the epistemic term quantifying the breach erosion
rate. The prediction intervals of peak discharge and final breach width are
congruent with values known from literature. To finally predict the outflow
hydrograph for real case applications, an alternative residual model was
formulated that assumes perfect data and a perfect model. The fully
probabilistic fashion of hydrograph prediction has the potential to improve the
adequate risk management of downstream flooding.

have a notion of how their environment behaves and to anticipate changes in the
near future. In this work, we focus on anticipating future appearance given the
current frame of a video. Existing work focuses on either predicting the future
appearance as the next frame of a video, or predicting future motion as optical
flow or motion trajectories starting from a single video frame. This work
stretches the ability of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to predict an
anticipation of appearance at an arbitrarily given future time, not necessarily
the next video frame. We condition our predicted future appearance on a
continuous time variable that allows us to anticipate future frames at a given
temporal distance, directly from the input video frame. We show that CNNs can
learn an intrinsic representation of typical appearance changes over time and
successfully generate realistic predictions at a deliberate time difference in

536,Deep Multi-User Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Access,"  We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access for network utility
maximization in multichannel wireless networks. The shared bandwidth is divided
into K orthogonal channels. In the beginning of each time slot, each user
selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain transmission
probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet
receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully
delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is a multi-user strategy for
accessing the spectrum that maximizes a certain network utility in a
distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between
users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is
computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial
observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel
distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user
reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its
current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used
to maximize the objective function. Game theoretic analysis of the system
dynamics is developed for establishing design principles for the implementation
of the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of the
algorithm.

Empirically, this general-purpose strategy is competitive with more specialised

various tasks. However, it is still very challenging to deploy state-of-the-art
models into real-world applications due to their high computational complexity.
How can we design a compact and effective network without massive experiments
and expert knowledge? In this paper, we propose a simple and effective
framework to learn and prune deep models in an end-to-end manner. In our
framework, a new type of parameter -- scaling factor is first introduced to
scale the outputs of specific structures, such as neurons, groups or residual
blocks. Then we add sparsity regularizations on these factors, and solve this
optimization problem by a modified stochastic Accelerated Proximal Gradient
(APG) method. By forcing some of the factors to zero, we can safely remove the
corresponding structures, thus prune the unimportant parts of a CNN. Comparing
with other structure selection methods that may need thousands of trials or
iterative fine-tuning, our method is trained fully end-to-end in one training
pass without bells and whistles. We evaluate our method, Sparse Structure
Selection with several state-of-the-art CNNs, and demonstrate very promising
results with adaptive depth and width selection.

manifolds near the Fermi energy. Upon atomic displacements by optical phonons,
the symmetry lowers to space group 28 (Pma2), eliminating one glide plane along
c, the associated rotation and screw axis, and the inversion center. As a
result, twenty Weyl points emerge, including four type-II Weyl points in the

bands. Thus, optical phonons may offer control of the transition to a Weyl

follow an unknown generating mechanism which deviates from that of normal

Dirichlet process mixture (DPM). A sequential particle-based algorithm is
derived for posterior inference for the outlier model as well as the state of
the system to be estimated. The resulting algorithm is termed DPM based robust
PF (DPM-RPF). The nonparametric feature makes this algorithm allow the data to
""speak for itself"" to determine the complexity and structure of the outlier
model. Simulation results show that it performs remarkably better than two
state-of-the-art methods especially when outliers appear frequently along time.

545,Rotating Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence,"  The turbulent Rayleigh--Taylor system in a rotating reference frame is
investigated by direct numerical simulations within the Oberbeck-Boussinesq
approximation. On the basis of theoretical arguments, supported by our
simulations, we show that the Rossby number decreases in time, and therefore
the Coriolis force becomes more important as the system evolves and produces
many effects on Rayleigh--Taylor turbulence. We find that rotation reduces the
intensity of turbulent velocity fluctuations and therefore the growth rate of
the temperature mixing layer. Moreover, in presence of rotation the conversion
of potential energy into turbulent kinetic energy is found to be less effective
and the efficiency of the heat transfer is reduced. Finally, during the
evolution of the mixing layer we observe the development of a
cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry.

546,Evolutionary dynamics of N-person Hawk-Dove games,"  In the animal world, the competition between individuals belonging to
different species for a resource often requires the cooperation of several
individuals in groups. This paper proposes a generalization of the Hawk-Dove
Game for an arbitrary number of agents: the N-person Hawk-Dove Game. In this
model, doves exemplify the cooperative behavior without intraspecies conflict,
while hawks represent the aggressive behavior. In the absence of hawks, doves
share the resource equally and avoid conflict, but having hawks around lead to
doves escaping without fighting. Conversely, hawks fight for the resource at
the cost of getting injured. Nevertheless, if doves are present in sufficient
number to expel the hawks, they can aggregate to protect the resource, and thus
avoid being plundered by hawks. We derive and numerically solve an exact
equation for the evolution of the system in both finite and infinite well-mixed
populations, finding the conditions for stable coexistence between both
species. Furthermore, by varying the different parameters, we found a scenario
of bifurcations that leads the system from dominating hawks and coexistence to
bi-stability, multiple interior equilibria and dominating doves.

highly subjective nature. Even for the same person, the best summary may change
with time or mood. In this paper, we introduce the task of generating
customized video summaries through simple text. First, we train a deep
architecture to effectively learn semantic embeddings of video frames by
leveraging the abundance of image-caption data via a progressive and residual
manner. Given a user-specific text description, our algorithm is able to select
semantically relevant video segments and produce a temporally aligned video
summary. In order to evaluate our textually customized video summaries, we
conduct experimental comparison with baseline methods that utilize ground-truth
information. Despite the challenging baselines, our method still manages to
show comparable or even exceeding performance. We also show that our method is
able to generate semantically diverse video summaries by only utilizing the
learned visual embeddings.

548,Observation of surface plasmon polaritons in 2D electron gas of surface electron accumulation in InN nanostructures,"  Recently, heavily doped semiconductors are emerging as an alternate for low
loss plasmonic materials. InN, belonging to the group III nitrides, possesses
the unique property of surface electron accumulation (SEA) which provides two
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system. In this report, we demonstrated the
surface plasmon properties of InN nanoparticles originating from SEA using the
real space mapping of the surface plasmon fields for the first time. The SEA is
confirmed by Raman studies which are further corroborated by photoluminescence
and photoemission spectroscopic studies. The frequency of 2DEG corresponding to
SEA is found to be in the THz region. The periodic fringes are observed in the
near-field scanning optical microscopic images of InN nanostructures. The
observed fringes are attributed to the interference of propagated and back
reflected surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The observation of SPPs is solely
attributed to the 2DEG corresponding to the SEA of InN. In addition, resonance
kind of behavior with the enhancement of the near-field intensity is observed
in the near-field images of InN nanostructures. Observation of SPPs indicates
that InN with SEA can be a promising THz plasmonic material for the light
confinement.

a new recoil diagram which is qualitatively different from the well-known
diagram associated with the Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer. We predict a new
asymmetric Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer (AMZAI) and study it when one uses
a Raman beam splitter. The main feature is that the phase of AMZAI contains a
quantum part proportional to the recoil frequency. A response sensitive only to
the quantum phase was found. A new technique to measure the recoil frequency
and fine structure constant is proposed and studied outside of the Raman-Nath

551,Inter-Session Modeling for Session-Based Recommendation,"  In recent years, research has been done on applying Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) as recommender systems. Results have been promising, especially in the
session-based setting where RNNs have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art
models. In many of these experiments, the RNN could potentially improve the
recommendations by utilizing information about the user's past sessions, in
addition to its own interactions in the current session. A problem for
session-based recommendation, is how to produce accurate recommendations at the
start of a session, before the system has learned much about the user's current
interests. We propose a novel approach that extends a RNN recommender to be
able to process the user's recent sessions, in order to improve
recommendations. This is done by using a second RNN to learn from recent
sessions, and predict the user's interest in the current session. By feeding
this information to the original RNN, it is able to improve its
recommendations. Our experiments on two different datasets show that the
proposed approach can significantly improve recommendations throughout the
sessions, compared to a single RNN working only on the current session. The
proposed model especially improves recommendations at the start of sessions,
and is therefore able to deal with the cold start problem within sessions.

role in the chemical initiation of energetic materials. The shock response of
hexanitrostilbene is studied through a combination of large scale reactive
molecular dynamics and mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. In order to extend
our simulation capability at the mesoscale to include weak shock conditions (<
6 GPa), atomistic simulations of pore collapse are used to define a strain rate
dependent strength model. Comparing these simulation methods allows us to
impose physically-reasonable constraints on the mesoscale model parameters. In
doing so, we have been able to study shock waves interacting with pores as a
function of this viscoplastic material response. We find that the pore collapse
behavior of weak shocks is characteristically different to that of strong
shocks.

double exponential transformation for calculating particular improper

555,Ultra-high strain in epitaxial silicon carbide nanostructures utilizing residual stress amplification,"  Strain engineering has attracted great attention, particularly for epitaxial
films grown on a different substrate. Residual strains of SiC have been widely
employed to form ultra-high frequency and high Q factor resonators. However, to
date the highest residual strain of SiC was reported to be limited to
approximately 0.6%. Large strains induced into SiC could lead to several
interesting physical phenomena, as well as significant improvement of resonant
frequencies. We report an unprecedented nano strain-amplifier structure with an
ultra-high residual strain up to 8% utilizing the natural residual stress
between epitaxial 3C SiC and Si. In addition, the applied strain can be tuned
by changing the dimensions of the amplifier structure. The possibility of
introducing such a controllable and ultra-high strain will open the door to
investigating the physics of SiC in large strain regimes, and the development
of ultra sensitive mechanical sensors.

556,The Diverse Club: The Integrative Core of Complex Networks,"  A complex system can be represented and analyzed as a network, where nodes
represent the units of the network and edges represent connections between
those units. For example, a brain network represents neurons as nodes and axons
between neurons as edges. In many networks, some nodes have a
disproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges
between each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different
networks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network
integration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity
structure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a
myriad of different biological and man-made networks, we discover the diverse
club--a set of nodes that have edges diversely distributed across the network.
The diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties
consistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly
interconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global
integration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that
produces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating
that these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures.
Given the variety of different networks that we analyzed--the c. elegans, the
macaque brain, the human brain, the United States power grid, and global air
traffic--the diverse club appears to be ubiquitous in complex networks. These
results warrant the distinction and analysis of two critical clubs of nodes in
all complex systems.

557,Bayesian Semisupervised Learning with Deep Generative Models,"  Neural network based generative models with discriminative components are a
powerful approach for semi-supervised learning. However, these techniques a)
cannot account for model uncertainty in the estimation of the model's
discriminative component and b) lack flexibility to capture complex stochastic
patterns in the label generation process. To avoid these problems, we first
propose to use a discriminative component with stochastic inputs for increased
noise flexibility. We show how an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure can
marginalize the stochastic inputs when inferring missing labels in this model.
Following this, we extend the discriminative component to be fully Bayesian and
produce estimates of uncertainty in its parameter values. This opens the door
for semi-supervised Bayesian active learning.

in clinical trials is critical for optimizing the drug development process. The
increasing volume of data accumulated in clinical trials provides a unique
opportunity to discover new biomarkers and further the goal of personalized
medicine, but it also requires innovative robust biomarker detection methods
capable of detecting non-linear, and sometimes weak, signals. We propose a set
of novel univariate statistical tests, based on the theory of random walks,
which are able to capture non-linear and non-monotonic covariate-treatment
interactions. We also propose a novel combined test, which leverages the power
of all of our proposed univariate tests into a single general-case tool. We
present results for both synthetic trials as well as real-world clinical
trials, where we compare our method with state-of-the-art techniques and
demonstrate the utility and robustness of our approach.

559,The Future of RICH Detectors through the Light of the LHCb RICH,"  The limitations in performance of the present RICH system in the LHCb
experiment are given by the natural chromatic dispersion of the gaseous
Cherenkov radiator, the aberrations of the optical system and the pixel size of
the photon detectors. Moreover, the overall PID performance can be affected by
high detector occupancy as the pattern recognition becomes more difficult with
high particle multiplicities. This paper shows a way to improve performance by
systematically addressing each of the previously mentioned limitations. These
ideas are applied in the present and future upgrade phases of the LHCb
experiment. Although applied to specific circumstances, they are used as a
paradigm on what is achievable in the development and realisation of high

of the normalized volume function $\widehat{\rm vol}_{(X,D),x}$, if and only if
$v$ induces a degeneration to a K-semistable log Fano cone singularity.
Moreover, such a minimizer is unique among all quasi-monomial valuations up to
rescaling. As a consequence, we prove that for a klt singularity $x\in X$ on
the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of KÃƒÂ¤hler-Einstein Fano manifolds, the
intermediate K-semistable cone associated to its metric tangent cone is
uniquely determined by the algebraic structure of $x\in X$, hence confirming a
conjecture by Donaldson-Sun.

561,Higgs mode and its decay in a two dimensional antiferromagnet,"  Condensed-matter analogs of the Higgs boson in particle physics allow
insights into its behavior in different symmetries and dimensionalities.
Evidence for the Higgs mode has been reported in a number of different
settings, including ultracold atomic gases, disordered superconductors, and
dimerized quantum magnets. However, decay processes of the Higgs mode (which
are eminently important in particle physics) have not yet been studied in
condensed matter due to the lack of a suitable material system coupled to a
direct experimental probe. A quantitative understanding of these processes is
particularly important for low-dimensional systems where the Higgs mode decays
rapidly and has remained elusive to most experimental probes. Here, we discover
and study the Higgs mode in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet using
spin-polarized inelastic neutron scattering. Our spin-wave spectra of
Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ directly reveal a well-defined, dispersive Higgs mode, which
quickly decays into transverse Goldstone modes at the antiferromagnetic
ordering wavevector. Through a complete mapping of the transverse modes in the
reciprocal space, we uniquely specify the minimal model Hamiltonian and
describe the decay process. We thus establish a novel condensed matter platform
for research on the dynamics of the Higgs mode.

however, suffers from overfitting when class-conditional distributions have
significant overlap. Moreover, it is very sensitive to noise that appears in
the labels. This article tackles the above limitations simultaneously via
optimizing a modified loss function (i.e., the conditional risk). The proposed
approach has the following two advantages. (1) It is able to directly take into
account label uncertainty with an associated label confidence. (2) It
introduces a ""trustworthiness"" measure on training samples via the Bayesian
risk rule, and hence the resulting classifier tends to have finite sample
performance that is superior to that of the original AdaBoost when there is a
large overlap between class conditional distributions. Theoretical properties
of the proposed method are investigated. Extensive experimental results using
synthetic data and real-world data sets from UCI machine learning repository
are provided. The empirical study shows the high competitiveness of the
proposed method in predication accuracy and robustness when compared with the
original AdaBoost and several existing robust AdaBoost algorithms.

563,Stop talking to me -- a communication-avoiding ADER-DG realisation,"  We present a communication- and data-sensitive formulation of ADER-DG for
hyperbolic differential equation systems. Sensitive here has multiple flavours:
First, the formulation reduces the persistent memory footprint. This reduces
pressure on the memory subsystem. Second, the formulation realises the
underlying predictor-corrector scheme with single-touch semantics, i.e., each
degree of freedom is read on average only once per time step from the main
memory. This reduces communication through the memory controllers. Third, the
formulation breaks up the tight coupling of the explicit time stepping's
algorithmic steps to mesh traversals. This averages out data access peaks.
Different operations and algorithmic steps are ran on different grid entities.
Finally, the formulation hides distributed memory data transfer behind the
computation aligned with the mesh traversal. This reduces pressure on the
machine interconnects. All techniques applied by our formulation are elaborated
by means of a rigorous task formalism. They break up ADER-DG's tight causal
coupling of compute steps and can be generalised to other predictor-corrector
schemes.

564,The effect of prior probabilities on quantification and propagation of imprecise probabilities resulting from small datasets,"  This paper outlines a methodology for Bayesian multimodel uncertainty
quantification (UQ) and propagation and presents an investigation into the
effect of prior probabilities on the resulting uncertainties. The UQ
methodology is adapted from the information-theoretic method previously
presented by the authors (Zhang and Shields, 2018) to a fully Bayesian
construction that enables greater flexibility in quantifying uncertainty in
probability model form. Being Bayesian in nature and rooted in UQ from small
datasets, prior probabilities in both probability model form and model
parameters are shown to have a significant impact on quantified uncertainties
and, consequently, on the uncertainties propagated through a physics-based
model. These effects are specifically investigated for a simplified plate
buckling problem with uncertainties in material properties derived from a small
number of experiments using noninformative priors and priors derived from past
studies of varying appropriateness. It is illustrated that prior probabilities
can have a significant impact on multimodel UQ for small datasets and
inappropriate (but seemingly reasonable) priors may even have lingering effects
that bias probabilities even for large datasets. When applied to uncertainty
propagation, this may result in probability bounds on response quantities that
do not include the true probabilities.

from a set of reduced parameters. A convolutional neural network is trained on
a collection of discrete, parameterizable fluid simulation velocity fields. Due
to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative
features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate
the training data set, while providing plausible interpolated in-betweens. The
proposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that
guarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we
demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and
advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second
network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling
applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids
with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and
compression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are
generated up to 700x faster than traditional CPU solvers, while achieving
compression rates of over 1300x.

conjunction with a selected feature extractor, to a subset of the ImageNet

merely about 2 % the result achieved by (supervised) k-Nearest Neighbor, both
using same feature extractor. This result may also be contrasted with popular

fundamental problem in network analysis. Core and truss decompositions reveal
dense subgraphs with hierarchical relations. The incremental nature of
algorithms for computing these decompositions and the need for global
information at each step of the algorithm hinders scalable parallelization and
approximations since the densest regions are not revealed until the end. In a
previous work, Lu et al. proposed to iteratively compute the $h$-indices of
neighbor vertex degrees to obtain the core numbers and prove that the
convergence is obtained after a finite number of iterations. This work
generalizes the iterative $h$-index computation for truss decomposition as well
as nucleus decomposition which leverages higher-order structures to generalize
core and truss decompositions. In addition, we prove convergence bounds on the
number of iterations. We present a framework of local algorithms to obtain the
core, truss, and nucleus decompositions. Our algorithms are local, parallel,
offer high scalability, and enable approximations to explore time and quality

high-risk tasks and helping in case of emergency. A gesture communication
language (CADDIAN) is developed, based on consolidated and standardized diver
gestures, including an alphabet, syntax and semantics, ensuring a logical
consistency. A hierarchical classification approach is introduced for hand
gesture recognition based on stereo imagery and multi-descriptor aggregation to
specifically cope with underwater image artifacts, e.g. light backscatter or
color attenuation. Once the classification task is finished, a syntax check is
performed to filter out invalid command sequences sent by the diver or
generated by errors in the classifier. Throughout this process, the diver
receives constant feedback from an underwater tablet to acknowledge or abort
the mission at any time. The objective is to prevent the AUV from executing
unnecessary, infeasible or potentially harmful motions. Experimental results
under different environmental conditions in archaeological exploration and
bridge inspection applications show that the system performs well in the field.

A15 and fcc forms of Cs$_3$C$_{60}$ exhibit superconducting states varying
under hydrostatic pressure with highest transition temperatures at $T_\textrm
{C}$$^\textrm {meas}$ = 38.3 and 35.2 K, respectively. Herein it is argued that
these two compounds under pressure represent the optimal materials of the
$\textit {A}$$_3$C$_{60}$ family, and that the C$_{60}$-associated
superconductivity is mediated through Coulombic interactions with charges on
the alkalis. A derivation of the interlayer Coulombic pairing model of
high-$T_\textrm {C}$ superconductivity employing non-planar geometry is
introduced, generalizing the picture of two interacting layers to an
interaction between charge reservoirs located on the C$_{60}$ and alkali ions.
The optimal transition temperature follows the algebraic expression, $T_\textrm
{C0}$ = (12.474 nm$^2$ K)/$\ell$${\zeta}$, where $\ell$ relates to the mean
spacing between interacting surface charges on the C$_{60}$ and ${\zeta}$ is
the average radial distance between the C$_{60}$ surface and the neighboring Cs
ions. Values of $T_\textrm {C0}$ for the measured cation stoichiometries of
Cs$_{3-\textrm{x}}$C$_{60}$ with x $\approx$ 0 are found to be 38.19 and 36.88
K for the A15 and fcc forms, respectively, with the dichotomy in transition
temperature reflecting the larger ${\zeta}$ and structural disorder in the fcc
form. In the A15 form, modeled interacting charges and Coulomb potential
e$^2$/${\zeta}$ are shown to agree quantitatively with findings from
nuclear-spin relaxation and mid-infrared optical conductivity. In the fcc form,
suppression of $T_\textrm {C}$$^\textrm {meas}$ below $T_\textrm {C0}$ is
ascribed to native structural disorder. Phononic effects in conjunction with
Coulombic pairing are discussed.

results from a combination of materials and fabrication process improvements

We then apply this analysis to determine the extent to which trenching can

National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) magnetron $H^{-}$ ion source due to

for High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments were extracted at ~18 keV vertically
downward into a 90 degree bending magnet and accelerated through a
Cockcroft-Walton accelerating column to 750 keV. Following the upgrade in the
fall of 2012 the $H^{-}$ ions are now directly extracted from a magnetron at 35
keV and accelerated to 750 keV by a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). This
change in extraction energy as well as the orientation of the ion source
required not only a redesign of the ion source, but an updated understanding of
its operation at these new values. Discussed in detail are the changes to the
ion source timing, arc discharge current, hydrogen gas pressure, and cesium
delivery system that were needed to maintain consistent operation at >99%
uptime for HEP, with an increased ion source lifetime of over 9 months.

576,A Ball Breaking Away from a Fluid,"  We consider the withdrawal of a ball from a fluid reservoir to understand the
longevity of the connection between that ball and the fluid it breaks away
from, at intermediate Reynolds numbers. Scaling arguments based on the
processes observed as the ball interacts with the fluid surface were applied to
the `pinch-off time', when the ball breaks its connection with the fluid from
which it has been withdrawn, measured experimentally. At the lowest Reynolds
numbers tested, pinch-off occurs in a `surface seal' close to the reservoir
surface, where at larger Reynolds numbers pinch-off occurs in an `ejecta seal'
close to the ball. Our scaling analysis shows that the connection between ball
and fluid is controlled by the fluid film draining from the ball as it
continues to be winched away from the fluid reservoir. The draining flow itself
depends on the amount of fluid coating the ball on exit from the reservoir. We
consider the possibilities that this coating was created through: a surface
tension driven Landau Levitch Derjaguin wetting of the surface; a
visco-inertial quick coating; or alternatively through the inertia of the fluid
moving with the ball through the reservoir. We show that although the pinch-off
mechanism is controlled by viscosity, the coating mechanism is governed by a
different length and timescale, dictated by the inertial added mass of the ball
when submersed.

problem to deconstruct the Kondo singlet, both in real and energy space, by
studying the contribution of each individual free electron eigenstate. This is
a problem of two spins coupled to a bath, where the bath is formed by the
remaining conduction electrons. Being a mixed state, we resort to the
""concurrence"" to quantify entanglement. We identify ""projected natural
orbitals"" that allow us to individualize a single-particle electronic wave
function that is responsible of more than $90\%$ of the impurity screening. In
the weak coupling regime, the impurity is entangled to an electron at the Fermi
level, while in the strong coupling regime, the impurity counterintuitively
entangles mostly with the high energy electrons and disentangles completely
from the low-energy states carving a ""hole"" around the Fermi level. This
enables one to use concurrence as a pseudo order parameter to compute the
characteristic ""size"" of the Kondo cloud, beyond which electrons are are weakly
correlated to the impurity and are dominated by the physics of the boundary.

578,Dynamics of the multi-soliton waves in the sine-Gordon model with two identical point impurities,"  The particular type of four-kink multi-solitons (or quadrons) adiabatic
dynamics of the sine-Gordon equation in a model with two identical point
attracting impurities has been studied. This model can be used for describing
magnetization localized waves in multilayer ferromagnet. The quadrons structure
and properties has been numerically investigated. The cases of both large and
small distances between impurities has been viewed. The dependence of the
localized in impurity region nonlinear high-amplitude waves frequencies on the
distance between the impurities has been found. For an analytical description
of two bound localized on impurities nonlinear waves dynamics, using
perturbation theory, the system of differential equations for harmonic
oscillators with elastic link has been found. The analytical model
qualitatively describes the results of the sine-Gordon equation numerical
simulation.

579,Clarifying the Hubble constant tension with a Bayesian hierarchical model of the local distance ladder,"  Estimates of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, from the distance ladder and the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) differ at the $\sim$3-$\sigma$ level,
indicating a potential issue with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Interpreting this tension correctly requires a model comparison calculation
depending on not only the traditional `$n$-$\sigma$' mismatch but also the
tails of the likelihoods. Determining the form of the tails of the local $H_0$
likelihood is impossible with the standard Gaussian least-squares
approximation, as it requires using non-Gaussian distributions to faithfully
represent anchor likelihoods and model outliers in the Cepheid and supernova
(SN) populations, and simultaneous fitting of the full distance-ladder dataset
to correctly propagate uncertainties. We have developed a Bayesian hierarchical
model that describes the full distance ladder, from nearby geometric anchors
through Cepheids to Hubble-Flow SNe. This model does not rely on any
distributions being Gaussian, allowing outliers to be modeled and obviating the
need for arbitrary data cuts. Sampling from the $\sim$3000-parameter joint
posterior using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we find $H_0$ = (72.72 $\pm$ 1.67)
${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ when applied to the outlier-cleaned Riess et al.
(2016) data, and ($73.15 \pm 1.78$) ${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with SN
outliers reintroduced. Our high-fidelity sampling of the low-$H_0$ tail of the
distance-ladder likelihood allows us to apply Bayesian model comparison to
assess the evidence for deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. We set up this comparison
to yield a lower limit on the odds of the underlying model being $\Lambda$CDM
given the distance-ladder and Planck XIII (2016) CMB data. The odds against
$\Lambda$CDM are at worst 10:1 or 7:1, depending on whether the SNe outliers
are cut or modeled, or 60:1 if an approximation to the Planck Int. XLVI (2016)
likelihood is used.

580,Multi-User Multi-Armed Bandits for Uncoordinated Spectrum Access,"  A multi-user multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is used to develop algorithms
for uncoordinated spectrum access. The number of users is assumed to be unknown
to each user. A stochastic setting is first considered, where the rewards on a
channel are the same for each user. In contrast to prior work, it is assumed
that the number of users can possibly exceed the number of channels, and that
rewards can be non-zero even under collisions. The proposed algorithm consists
of an estimation phase and an allocation phase. It is shown that if every user
adopts the algorithm, the system wide regret is constant with time with high
probability. The regret guarantees hold for any number of users and channels,
in particular, even when the number of users is less than the number of
channels. Next, an adversarial multi-user MAB framework is considered, where
the rewards on the channels are user-dependent. It is assumed that the number
of users is less than the number of channels, and that the users receive zero
reward on collision. The proposed algorithm combines the Exp3.P algorithm
developed in prior work for single user adversarial bandits with a collision
resolution mechanism to achieve sub-linear regret. It is shown that if every
user employs the proposed algorithm, the system wide regret is of the order
$O(T^\frac{3}{4})$ over a horizon of time $T$. The algorithms in both
stochastic and adversarial scenarios are extended to the dynamic case where the
number of users in the system evolves over time and are shown to lead to
sub-linear regret.

581,A Comparative Analysis of Contact Models in Trajectory Optimization for Manipulation,"  In this paper, we analyze the effects of contact models on contact-implicit
trajectory optimization for manipulation. We consider three different
approaches: (1) a contact model that is based on complementarity constraints,
(2) a smooth contact model, and our proposed method (3) a variable smooth
contact model. We compare these models in simulation in terms of physical
accuracy, quality of motions, and computation time. In each case, the
optimization process is initialized by setting all torque variables to zero,
namely, without a meaningful initial guess. For simulations, we consider a
pushing task with varying complexity for a 7 degrees-of-freedom robot arm. Our
results demonstrate that the optimization based on the proposed variable smooth
contact model provides a good trade-off between the physical fidelity and
quality of motions at the cost of increased computation time.

582,Defining and estimating stochastic rate change in a dynamic general insurance portfolio,"  Rate change calculations in the literature involve deterministic methods that
measure the change in premium for a given policy. The definition of rate change
as a statistical parameter is proposed to address the stochastic nature of the
premium charged for a policy. It promotes the idea that rate change is a
property of an asymptotic population to be estimated, not just a property to
measure or monitor in the sample of observed policies that are written. Various
models and techniques are given for estimating this stochastic rate change and
quantifying the uncertainty in the estimates. The use of matched sampling is
emphasized for rate change estimation, as it adjusts for changes in policy
characteristics by directly searching for similar policies across policy years.
This avoids any of the assumptions and recipes that are required to re-rate
policies in years where they were not written, as is common with deterministic
methods. Such procedures can be subjective or implausible if the structure of
rating algorithms change or there are complex and heterogeneous exposure bases
and coverages. The methods discussed are applied to a motor premium database.
The application includes the use of a genetic algorithm with parallel
computations to automatically optimize the matched sampling.

584,Integrating electricity markets: Impacts of increasing trade on prices and emissions in the western United States,"  This paper analyzes the market impacts of expanding California's centralized
electricity market across the western United States and provides the first
statistical assessment of this issue. Using market data from 2015-2018, I
estimate the short-term effects of increasing regional electricity trade
between California and neighboring states on prices, emissions, and generation.
Consistent with economic theory, I find negative price impacts from regional
trade, with each 1 gigawatt-hour (GWh) increase in California electricity
imports associated with an average 0.15 dollar decrease in CAISO price. The
price effect yields significant consumer savings well in excess of
implementation costs required to set up a regional market. I find a short-term
decrease in California carbon dioxide emissions associated with trading that is
partially offset by increased emissions in neighboring regions. Specifically,
each 1 GWh increase in regional trade is associated with a net 70-ton average
decrease in CO2 emissions across the western U.S. A small amount of increased
SO2 and NOx emissions are also observed in neighboring states associated with
increased exports to California. This implies a small portion (less than 10
percent) of electricity exports to California are supplied by coal generation.
This study identifies substantial short-term monetary benefits from market
regionalization for California consumers. It also shows that California's cap
and trade program is relatively effective in limiting the carbon content of
imported electricity, even absent a regional cap on CO2. The conclusions
suggest efforts to reduce trade barriers should move forward in parallel with
strong greenhouse gas policies that cap emissions levels across the market
region.

short-term price predictive signal while trading. In the case where the trader
is creating an instantaneous market impact, we show that transactions costs
resulting from the optimal adaptive strategy are substantially lower than the
corresponding costs of the optimal static strategy. Later, we investigate the
case where the trader is creating transient market impact. We show that
strategies in which the trader is observing the signal a number of times during
the trading period, can dramatically reduce the transaction costs and improve
the performance of the optimal static strategy. These results answer a question
which was raised by Brigo and Piat [6], by analyzing two cases where adaptive
strategies can improve the performance of the execution.

For the regression piece, we discuss various non-parametric approaches, in
particular introducing the use of Gaussian process regression in the context of
stochastic storage. For simulation design, we compare the performance of
traditional design (grid discretization), against space-filling, and several
adaptive alternatives. The overall DEA template is illustrated with multiple
examples drawing from natural gas storage valuation and optimal control of

591,"A dynamic network model with persistent links and node-specific latent variables, with an application to the interbank market","  We propose a dynamic network model where two mechanisms control the
probability of a link between two nodes: (i) the existence or absence of this
link in the past, and (ii) node-specific latent variables (dynamic fitnesses)
describing the propensity of each node to create links. Assuming a Markov
dynamics for both mechanisms, we propose an Expectation-Maximization algorithm
for model estimation and inference of the latent variables. The estimated
parameters and fitnesses can be used to forecast the presence of a link in the
future. We apply our methodology to the e-MID interbank network for which the
two linkage mechanisms are associated with two different trading behaviors in
the process of network formation, namely preferential trading and trading
driven by node-specific characteristics. The empirical results allow to
recognise preferential lending in the interbank market and indicate how a
method that does not account for time-varying network topologies tends to
overestimate preferential linkage.

592,Time consistency for scalar multivariate risk measures,"  In this paper we present results on dynamic multivariate scalar risk
measures, which arise in markets with transaction costs and systemic risk. Dual
representations of such risk measures are presented. These are then used to
obtain the main results of this paper on time consistency; namely, an
equivalent recursive formulation of multivariate scalar risk measures to
multiportfolio time consistency. We are motivated to study time consistency of
multivariate scalar risk measures as the superhedging risk measure in markets
with transaction costs (with a single eligible asset) (Jouini and Kallal
(1995), Roux and Zastawniak (2016), Loehne and Rudloff (2014)) does not satisfy
the usual scalar concept of time consistency. In fact, as demonstrated in
(Feinstein and Rudloff (2018)), scalar risk measures with the same
scalarization weight at all times would not be time consistent in general. The
deduced recursive relation for the scalarizations of multiportfolio time
consistent set-valued risk measures provided in this paper requires
consideration of the entire family of scalarizations. In this way we develop a
direct notion of a ""moving scalarization"" for scalar time consistency that
corroborates recent research on scalarizations of dynamic multi-objective
problems (Karnam, Ma, and Zhang (2017), Kovacova and Rudloff (2018)).

594,Extended opportunity cost model to find near equilibrium electricity prices under non-convexities,"  This paper finds near equilibrium prices for electricity markets with
nonconvexities due to binary variables, in order to reduce the market
participants' opportunity costs, such as generators' unrecovered costs. The
opportunity cost is defined as the difference between the profit when the
instructions of the market operator are followed and when the market
participants can freely make their own decisions based on the market prices. We
use the minimum complementarity approximation to the minimum total opportunity
cost (MTOC) model, from previous research, with tests on a much more realistic
unit commitment (UC) model than in previous research, including features such
as reserve requirements, ramping constraints, and minimum up and down times.
The developed model incorporates flexible price responsive demand, as in
previous research, but since not all demand is price responsive, we consider
the more realistic case that total demand is a mixture of fixed and flexible.
Another improvement over previous MTOC research is computational: whereas the
previous research had nonconvex terms among the objective function's continuous
variables, we convert the objective to an equivalent form that contains only
linear and convex quadratic terms in the continuous variables. We compare the
unit commitment model with the standard social welfare optimization version of
UC, in a series of sensitivity analyses, varying flexible demand to represent
varying degrees of future penetration of electric vehicles and smart
appliances, different ratios of generation availability, and different values
of transmission line capacities to consider possible congestion. The minimum
total opportunity cost and social welfare solutions are mostly very close in
different scenarios, except in some extreme cases.

595,An Efficient Approach for Removing Look-ahead Bias in the Least Square Monte Carlo Algorithm: Leave-One-Out,"  The least square Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm proposed by Longstaff and

exercise features. The LSM estimator contains look-ahead bias, and the
conventional technique of removing it necessitates an independent set of
simulations. This study proposes a new approach for efficiently eliminating
look-ahead bias by using the leave-one-out method, a well-known
cross-validation technique for machine learning applications. The leave-one-out
LSM (LOOLSM) method is illustrated with examples, including multi-asset options
whose LSM price is biased high. The asymptotic behavior of look-ahead bias is
also discussed with the LOOLSM approach.

of the asset returns distribution, like the mean vector and the covariance
matrix are unknown and have to be estimated by using historical data of the
asset returns. The new approach employs the Bayesian posterior predictive
distribution which is the distribution of the future realization of the asset
returns given the observable sample. The parameters of the posterior predictive
distributions are functions of the observed data values and, consequently, the
solution of the optimization problem is expressed in terms of data only and
does not depend on unknown quantities. In contrast, the optimization problem of
the traditional approach is based on unknown quantities which are estimated in
the second step leading to a suboptimal solution. We also derive a very useful
stochastic representation of the posterior predictive distribution whose
application leads not only to the solution of the considered optimization
problem, but provides the posterior predictive distribution of the optimal
portfolio return used to construct a prediction interval. A Bayesian efficient
frontier, a set of optimal portfolios obtained by employing the posterior
predictive distribution, is constructed as well. Theoretically and using real
data we show that the Bayesian efficient frontier outperforms the sample
efficient frontier, a common estimator of the set of optimal portfolios known
to be overoptimistic.

the excellent learning performance of support vector machine, the technology

of interest when interpreting deep learning models. In recent work, Dhamdhere
et al. proposed Total Conductance, a ""natural refinement of Integrated
Gradients"" for attributing importance to internal neurons. Unfortunately, the
authors found that calculating conductance in tensorflow required the addition
of several custom gradient operators and did not scale well. In this work, we
show that the formula for Total Conductance is mathematically equivalent to
Path Integrated Gradients computed on a hidden layer in the network. We provide
a scalable implementation of Total Conductance using standard tensorflow
gradient operators that we call Neuron Integrated Gradients. We compare Neuron
Integrated Gradients to DeepLIFT, a pre-existing computationally efficient
approach that is applicable to calculating internal neuron importance. We find
that DeepLIFT produces strong empirical results and is faster to compute, but
because it lacks the theoretical properties of Neuron Integrated Gradients, it
may not always be preferred in practice. Colab notebook reproducing results:

605,Is It Safe to Uplift This Patch? An Empirical Study on Mozilla Firefox,"  In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or
implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development
channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more
stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is
risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end
up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift
operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted
patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we
quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift
decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced
regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to
understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and
outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong
functionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have
larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors
in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift
requests that concern certain specific components, and-or that are submitted by
certain specific developers.

interesting as a means of enabling sustainable, wireless communication without
the need to recharge or replace the battery driving the relays. However,
reliability of such communication systems becomes an important design challenge
when such relays scavenge energy from the information bearing RF signals
received from the source, using the technique of simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT). To this aim, this work studies
bidirectional communication in a decode-and-forward (DF) relay assisted
cooperative wireless network in presence of co-channel interference (CCI). In
order to quantify the reliability of the bidirectional communication systems, a
closed form expression for the outage probability of the system is derived for
both power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) mode of operation of the
relay. Simulation results are used to validate the accuracy of our analytical
results and illustrate the dependence of the outage probability on various
system parameters, like PS factor, TS factor, and distance of the relay from
both the users. Results of performance comparison between PS relaying (PSR) and
TS relaying (TSR) schemes are also presented. Besides, simulation results are
also used to illustrate the spectral-efficiency and the energy-efficiency of
the proposed system. The results show that, both in terms of spectral
efficiency and the energy-efficiency, the two-way communication system in
presence of moderate CCI power, performs better than the similar system without
CCI. Additionally, it is also found that PSR is superior to TSR protocol in
terms of peak energy-efficiency.

to tackle optimization, classification, and automatic features selection
related tasks. The widespread use of GP is mainly due to its flexible and
comprehensible tree-type structure. Similarly, research is also gaining
momentum in the field of Image Processing (IP) because of its promising results
over wide areas of applications ranging from medical IP to multispectral
imaging. IP is mainly involved in applications such as computer vision, pattern
recognition, image compression, storage and transmission, and medical
diagnostics. This prevailing nature of images and their associated algorithm
i.e complexities gave an impetus to the exploration of GP. GP has thus been
used in different ways for IP since its inception. Many interesting GP
techniques have been developed and employed in the field of IP. To give the
research community an extensive view of these techniques, this paper presents
the diverse applications of GP in IP and provides useful resources for further
research. Also, comparison of different parameters used in ten different
applications of IP are summarized in tabular form. Moreover, analysis of
different parameters used in IP related tasks is carried-out to save the time
needed in future for evaluating the parameters of GP. As more advancement is
made in GP methodologies, its success in solving complex tasks not only related
to IP but also in other fields will increase. Additionally, guidelines are
provided for applying GP in IP related tasks, pros and cons of GP techniques
are discussed, and some future directions are also set.

612,Optimal Input Placement in Lattice Graphs,"  The control of dynamical, networked systems continues to receive much
attention across the engineering and scientific research fields. Of particular
interest is the proper way to determine which nodes of the network should
receive external control inputs in order to effectively and efficiently control
portions of the network. Published methods to accomplish this task either find
a minimal set of driver nodes to guarantee controllability or a larger set of
driver nodes which optimizes some control metric. Here, we investigate the
control of lattice systems which provides analytical insight into the
relationship between network structure and controllability. First we derive a
closed form expression for the individual elements of the controllability
Gramian of infinite lattice systems. Second, we focus on nearest neighbor
lattices for which the distance between nodes appears in the expression for the
controllability Gramian. We show that common control energy metrics scale

614,The X-ray reflection spectrum of the radio-loud quasar 4C 74.26,"  The relativistic jets created by some active galactic nuclei are important
agents of AGN feedback. In spite of this, our understanding of what produces
these jets is still incomplete. X-ray observations, which can probe the
processes operating in the central regions in immediate vicinity of the
supermassive black hole, the presumed jet launching point, are potentially
particularly valuable in illuminating the jet formation process. Here, we
present the hard X-ray NuSTAR observations of the radio-loud quasar 4C 74.26 in
a joint analysis with quasi-simultaneous, soft X-ray Swift observations. Our
spectral analysis reveals a high-energy cut-off of 183$_{-35}^{+51}$ keV and
confirms the presence of ionized reflection in the source. From the average
spectrum we detect that the accretion disk is mildly recessed with an inner
radius of $R_\mathrm{in}=4-180\,R_\mathrm{g}$. However, no significant
evolution of the inner radius is seen during the three months covered by our
NuSTAR campaign. This lack of variation could mean that the jet formation in
this radio-loud quasar differs from what is observed in broad-line radio
galaxies.

615,Tree Structured Synthesis of Gaussian Trees,"  A new synthesis scheme is proposed to effectively generate a random vector
with prescribed joint density that induces a (latent) Gaussian tree structure.
The quality of synthesis is measured by total variation distance between the
synthesized and desired statistics. The proposed layered and successive
encoding scheme relies on the learned structure of tree to use minimal number
of common random variables to synthesize the desired density. We characterize
the achievable rate region for the rate tuples of multi-layer latent Gaussian
tree, through which the number of bits needed to simulate such Gaussian joint
density are determined. The random sources used in our algorithm are the latent
variables at the top layer of tree, the additive independent Gaussian noises,
and the Bernoulli sign inputs that capture the ambiguity of correlation signs
between the variables.

616,Information Retrieval and Recommendation System for Astronomical Observatories,"  We present a machine learning based information retrieval system for
astronomical observatories that tries to address user defined queries related
to an instrument. In the modern instrumentation scenario where heterogeneous
systems and talents are simultaneously at work, the ability to supply with the
right information helps speeding up the detector maintenance operations.
Enhancing the detector uptime leads to increased coincidence observation and
improves the likelihood for the detection of astrophysical signals. Besides,
such efforts will efficiently disseminate technical knowledge to a wider
audience and will help the ongoing efforts to build upcoming detectors like the
LIGO-India etc even at the design phase to foresee possible challenges. The
proposed method analyses existing documented efforts at the site to
intelligently group together related information to a query and to present it
on-line to the user. The user in response can further go into interesting links
and find already developed solutions or probable ways to address the present
situation optimally. A web application that incorporates the above idea has
been implemented and tested for LIGO Livingston, LIGO Hanford and Virgo
observatories.

617,Database Learning: Toward a Database that Becomes Smarter Every Time,"  In today's databases, previous query answers rarely benefit answering future
queries. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we change this
paradigm in an approximate query processing (AQP) context. We make the
following observation: the answer to each query reveals some degree of
knowledge about the answer to another query because their answers stem from the
same underlying distribution that has produced the entire dataset. Exploiting
and refining this knowledge should allow us to answer queries more
analytically, rather than by reading enormous amounts of raw data. Also,
processing more queries should continuously enhance our knowledge of the
underlying distribution, and hence lead to increasingly faster response times
for future queries.
We call this novel idea---learning from past query answers---Database
Learning. We exploit the principle of maximum entropy to produce answers, which
are in expectation guaranteed to be more accurate than existing sample-based
approximations. Empowered by this idea, we build a query engine on top of Spark
SQL, called Verdict. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world query
traces from a large customer of a major database vendor. Our results
demonstrate that Verdict supports 73.7% of these queries, speeding them up by
up to 23.0x for the same accuracy level compared to existing AQP systems.

618,A Continuous Relaxation of Beam Search for End-to-end Training of Neural Sequence Models,"  Beam search is a desirable choice of test-time decoding algorithm for neural
sequence models because it potentially avoids search errors made by simpler
greedy methods. However, typical cross entropy training procedures for these
models do not directly consider the behaviour of the final decoding method. As
a result, for cross-entropy trained models, beam decoding can sometimes yield
reduced test performance when compared with greedy decoding. In order to train
models that can more effectively make use of beam search, we propose a new
training procedure that focuses on the final loss metric (e.g. Hamming loss)
evaluated on the output of beam search. While well-defined, this ""direct loss""
objective is itself discontinuous and thus difficult to optimize. Hence, in our
approach, we form a sub-differentiable surrogate objective by introducing a
novel continuous approximation of the beam search decoding procedure. In
experiments, we show that optimizing this new training objective yields
substantially better results on two sequence tasks (Named Entity Recognition
and CCG Supertagging) when compared with both cross entropy trained greedy
decoding and cross entropy trained beam decoding baselines.

proved that they exist on every arbitrary free C- action defined on standard
probability space. In the same paper he asked about the minimal possible growth
of measurably entire functions. In this work we show that for every arbitrary
free C- action defined on a standard probability space there exists a
measurably entire function whose growth does not exceed exp (exp[log^p |z|])
for any p > 3. This complements a recent result by Buhovski, GlÃƒÂ¼cksam,
Logunov, and Sodin (arXiv:1703.08101) who showed that such functions cannot
grow slower than exp (exp[log^p |z|]) for any p < 2.

is completely $p$-primitive if for any non-zero integer $N$, the diophantine
equation $f(x,y)=N$ has always an integer solution $(x,y)=(m,n)$ with
$(m,n,p)=1$ whenever it has an integer solution. In this article, we study
various properties of completely $p$-primitive binary quadratic forms. In
particular, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a definite binary
quadratic form $f$ to be completely $p$-primitive.

621,Analysis of Multivariate Data and Repeated Measures Designs with the R Package MANOVA.RM,"  The numerical availability of statistical inference methods for a modern and
robust analysis of longitudinal- and multivariate data in factorial experiments
is an essential element in research and education. While existing approaches
that rely on specific distributional assumptions of the data (multivariate
normality and/or characteristic covariance matrices) are implemented in
statistical software packages, there is a need for user-friendly software that
can be used for the analysis of data that do not fulfill the aforementioned
assumptions and provide accurate p-value and confidence interval estimates.
Therefore, newly developed statistical methods for the analysis of repeated
measures designs and multivariate data that neither assume multivariate
normality nor specific covariance matrices have been implemented in the freely
available R-package MANOVA.RM. The package is equipped with a graphical user
interface for plausible applications in academia and other educational purpose.
Several motivating examples illustrate the application of the methods.

this is true regardless of whether the behaviors themselves are bespoke,
optimization based, or learned. We present an agent architecture and training
methodology using neural networks to learn task-oriented communication
semantics based on the example of a communication-unaware expert policy. A
perimeter defense game illustrates the system's ability to handle dynamically
changing numbers of agents and its graceful degradation in performance as
communication constraints are tightened or the expert's observability

627,The tumbling rotational state of 1I/`Oumuamua,"  The discovery of 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua) has provided the first glimpse of a
planetesimal born in another planetary system. This interloper exhibits a
variable colour within a range that is broadly consistent with local small
bodies such as the P/D type asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and dynamically excited
Kuiper Belt Objects. 1I/'Oumuamua appears unusually elongated in shape, with an
axial ratio exceeding 5:1. Rotation period estimates are inconsistent and
varied, with reported values between 6.9 and 8.3 hours. Here we analyse all
available optical photometry reported to date. No single rotation period can
explain the exhibited brightness variations. Rather, 1I/'Oumuamua appears to be
in an excited rotational state undergoing Non-Principal Axis (NPA) rotation, or
tumbling. A satisfactory solution has apparent lightcurve frequencies of 0.135
and 0.126 hr-1 and implies a longest-to-shortest axis ratio of 5:1, though the
available data are insufficient to uniquely constrain the true frequencies and
shape. Assuming a body that responds to NPA rotation in a similar manner to
Solar System asteroids and comets, the timescale to damp 1I/'Oumuamua's
tumbling is at least a billion years. 1I/'Oumuamua was likely set tumbling
within its parent planetary system, and will remain tumbling well after it has
left ours.

for regulating the topology of branched covering maps and that for monoidal
transformations which include the standard blowing-up process. Here the results
are presented as cap product pairings, which will be elements of a suitable
homology theory, rather than characteristic numbers as would be the case when
taking Kronecker products once PoincarÃƒÂ© duality is defined. We further
consider possible applications and examples including branched covering maps,
singular varieties involving virtual tangent bundles, the
Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class, the homology L-class, generalized signature,
and the cohomology signature class.

629,Video and Accelerometer-Based Motion Analysis for Automated Surgical Skills Assessment,"  Purpose: Basic surgical skills of suturing and knot tying are an essential
part of medical training. Having an automated system for surgical skills
assessment could help save experts time and improve training efficiency. There
have been some recent attempts at automated surgical skills assessment using
either video analysis or acceleration data. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated assessment of OSATS based surgical skills and provide an
analysis of different features on multi-modal data (video and accelerometer
data). Methods: We conduct the largest study, to the best of our knowledge, for
basic surgical skills assessment on a dataset that contained video and
accelerometer data for suturing and knot-tying tasks. We introduce ""entropy
based"" features - Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Cross-Approximate Entropy
(XApEn), which quantify the amount of predictability and regularity of
fluctuations in time-series data. The proposed features are compared to
existing methods of Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), for surgical skills assessment.
Results: We report average performance of different features across all
applicable OSATS criteria for suturing and knot tying tasks. Our analysis shows
that the proposed entropy based features out-perform previous state-of-the-art
methods using video data. For accelerometer data, our method performs better
for suturing only. We also show that fusion of video and acceleration features
can improve overall performance with the proposed entropy features achieving
highest accuracy. Conclusions: Automated surgical skills assessment can be
achieved with high accuracy using the proposed entropy features. Such a system
can significantly improve the efficiency of surgical training in medical
schools and teaching hospitals.

630,A Theory of Complex Stochastic Systems with Two Types of Counteracting Entities,"  Many complex systems share two characteristics: 1) they are stochastic in
nature, and 2) they are characterized by a large number of factors. At the same
time, various natural complex systems appear to have two types of intertwined
constituents that exhibit counteracting effects on their equilibrium. In this
study, we employ these few characteristics to lay the groundwork for analyzing
such complex systems. The equilibrium point of these systems is generally
studied either through the kinetic notion of equilibrium or its energetic
notion, but not both. We postulate that these systems attempt to regulate the
state vector of their constituents such that both the kinetic and the energetic
notions of equilibrium are met. Based on this postulate, we prove: 1) the
existence of a point such that the kinetic notion of equilibrium is met for the
less abundant constituents and, at the same time, the state vector of more
abundant entities is regulated to minimize the energetic notion of equilibrium;
2) the effect of unboundedly increasing less (more) abundant constituents
stabilizes (destabilizes) the system; and 3) the (unrestricted) equilibrium of
the system is the point at which the number of stabilizing and destabilizing
entities increase unboundedly with the same rate.

G is any almost simple affine algebraic group over k. We prove that the

groups which also contained Morse elements, infinite order elements whose
cyclic subgroup gives a Morse quasi-geodesic. Our result presents the first
example of a group which contains Morse geodesics but no Morse elements. In
fact, we show that there is an isometrically embedded $7$-regular tree inside
such groups where every infinite, simple path is a Morse geodesic.

635,Global and local thermometry schemes in coupled quantum systems,"  We study the ultimate bounds on the estimation of temperature for an
interacting quantum system. We consider two coupled bosonic modes that are
assumed to be thermal and using quantum estimation theory establish the role
the Hamiltonian parameters play in thermometry. We show that in the case of a
conserved particle number the interaction between the modes leads to a decrease
in the overall sensitivity to temperature, while interestingly, if particle
exchange is allowed with the thermal bath the converse is true. We explain this
dichotomy by examining the energy spectra. Finally, we devise experimentally
implementable thermometry schemes that rely only on locally accessible
information from the total system, showing that almost Heisenberg limited
precision can still be achieved, and we address the (im)possibility for
multiparameter estimation in the system.

F, G, K, and M dwarf stars. We provide here 60,949 precision radial velocities
for 1,624 stars contained in that survey. We tabulate a list of 357 significant
periodic signals that are of constant period and phase, and not coincident in
period and/or phase with stellar activity indices. These signals are thus
strongly suggestive of barycentric reflex motion of the star induced by one or
more candidate exoplanets in Keplerian motion about the host star. Of these
signals, 225 have already been published as planet claims, 60 are classified as
significant unpublished planet candidates that await photometric follow-up to
rule out activity-related causes, and 54 are also unpublished, but are
classified as ""significant"" signals that require confirmation by additional
data before rising to classification as planet candidates. Of particular
interest is our detection of a candidate planet with a minimum mass of 3.9
Earth masses and an orbital period of 9.9 days orbiting Lalande 21185, the
fourth-closest main sequence star to the Sun. For each of our exoplanetary
candidate signals, we provide the period and semi-amplitude of the Keplerian
orbital fit, and a likelihood ratio estimate of its statistical significance.
We also tabulate 18 Keplerian-like signals that we classify as likely arising

functions or tasks in the cyber-defense realm. However, as adversary methods
become more complex and difficult to divine, piecemeal efforts to understand
cyber-attacks, and malware-based attacks in particular, are not providing
sufficient means for malware analysts to understand the past, present and

In this paper, we present the Malware Analysis and Attributed using Genetic
Information (MAAGI) system. The underlying idea behind the MAAGI system is that
there are strong similarities between malware behavior and biological organism
behavior, and applying biologically inspired methods to corpora of malware can
help analysts better understand the ecosystem of malware attacks. Due to the
sophistication of the malware and the analysis, the MAAGI system relies heavily
on artificial intelligence techniques to provide this capability. It has
already yielded promising results over its development life, and will hopefully
inspire more integration between the artificial intelligence and cyber--defense

clamped-free damped string with respect to distributed and boundary
disturbances. While efficient methods for establishing ISS properties for
distributed parameter systems with respect to distributed disturbances have
been developed during the last decades, establishing ISS properties with
respect to boundary disturbances remains challenging. One of the well-known
methods for well-posedness analysis of systems with boundary inputs is to use
an adequate lifting operator, which transfers the boundary disturbance to a
distributed one. However, the resulting distributed disturbance involves time
derivatives of the boundary perturbation. Thus, the subsequent ISS estimate
depends on its amplitude, and may not be expressed in the strict form of ISS
properties. To solve this problem, we show for a clamped-free damped string
equation that the projection of the original system trajectories in an adequate
Riesz basis can be used to establish the desired ISS property.

proper importance to phonon assisted indirect processes and bleaching of direct
processes. We show indirect processes figure in the excess absorption in the UV
region. Experiments which were thought to indicate ultrafast relaxation of
electrons and holes, reaching a thermal distribution from an extremely
non-thermal one in under 5-10 fs, instead are explained by the nascent electron
and hole distributions produced by indirect transitions. These need no
relaxation or ad-hoc energy removal to agree with the observed emission spectra
and fast pulsed absorption spectra. The fast emission following pulsed
absorption is dominated by phonon assisted processes, which vastly outnumber
direct ones and are always available, connecting any electron with any hole any
time. Calculations are given, including explicitly calculating the magnitude of
indirect processes, supporting these views.

643,Analytic heating rate of neutron star merger ejecta derived from Fermi's theory of beta decay,"  Macronovae (kilonovae) that arise in binary neutron star mergers are powered
by radioactive beta decay of hundreds of $r$-process nuclides. We derive, using
Fermi's theory of beta decay, an analytic estimate of the nuclear heating rate.
We show that the heating rate evolves as a power law ranging between $t^{-6/5}$
to $t^{-4/3}$. The overall magnitude of the heating rate is determined by the
mean values of nuclear quantities, e.g., the nuclear matrix elements of beta
decay. These values are specified by using nuclear experimental data. We
discuss the role of higher order beta transitions and the robustness of the
power law. The robust and simple form of the heating rate suggests that
observations of the late-time bolometric light curve $\propto t^{-\frac{4}{3}}$
would be a direct evidence of a $r$-process driven macronova. Such observations
could also enable us to estimate the total amount of $r$-process nuclei
produced in the merger.

644,Molecular Simulation of Caloric Properties of Fluids Modelled by Force Fields with Intramolecular Contributions: Application to Heat Capacities,"  The calculation of caloric properties such as heat capacity, Joule-Thomson
coefficients and the speed of sound by classical force-field-based molecular
simulation methodology has received scant attention in the literature,
particularly for systems composed of complex molecules whose force fields (FFs)
are characterized by a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular terms
(referred to herein as ""flexible FFs""). The calculation of a thermodynamic
property for a system whose molecules are described by such a FF involves the
calculation of the residual property prior to its addition to the corresponding
ideal-gas (IG) property, the latter of which is separately calculated, either
using thermochemical compilations or nowadays accurate quantum mechanical
calculations. Although the simulation of a volumetric residual property
proceeds by simply replacing the intermolecular FF in the rigid molecule case
by the total (intramolecular plus intermolecular) FF, this is not the case for
a caloric property. We discuss the methodology required in performing such
calculations, and focus on the example of the molar heat capacity at constant
pressure, $c_P$, one of the most important caloric properties. We also consider
three approximations for the calculation procedure, and illustrate their
consequences for the examples of the relatively simple molecule 2-propanol,
${\rm CH_3CH(OH)CH_3}$, and for monoethanolamine, ${\rm HO(CH_2)_2NH_2}$, an
important fluid used in carbon capture.

646,Asynchronous Byzantine Machine Learning (the case of SGD),"  Asynchronous distributed machine learning solutions have proven very
effective so far, but always assuming perfectly functioning workers. In
practice, some of the workers can however exhibit Byzantine behavior, caused by
hardware failures, software bugs, corrupt data, or even malicious attacks. We
introduce \emph{Kardam}, the first distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) algorithm that copes with Byzantine workers. Kardam consists of
two complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first
is scalar-based and ensures resilience against $\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers.
Essentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts
as a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt
the progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by
adjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme. We
prove that Kardam guarantees almost sure convergence in the presence of
asynchrony and Byzantine behavior, and we derive its convergence rate. We
evaluate Kardam on the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets and measure its overhead
with respect to non Byzantine-resilient solutions. We empirically show that
Kardam does not introduce additional noise to the learning procedure but does
induce a slowdown (the cost of Byzantine resilience) that we both theoretically
and empirically show to be less than $f/n$, where $f$ is the number of
Byzantine failures tolerated and $n$ the total number of workers.
Interestingly, we also empirically observe that the dampening component is
interesting in its own right for it enables to build an SGD algorithm that
outperforms alternative staleness-aware asynchronous competitors in
environments with honest workers.

648,Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for Action Detection in Videos,"  Deep learning has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for image
classification and object detection. However, the impact of deep learning on
video analysis (e.g. action detection and recognition) has been limited due to
complexity of video data and lack of annotations. Previous convolutional neural
networks (CNN) based video action detection approaches usually consist of two
major steps: frame-level action proposal detection and association of proposals
across frames. Also, these methods employ two-stream CNN framework to handle
spatial and temporal feature separately. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end deep network called Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for
action detection in videos. The proposed architecture is a unified network that
is able to recognize and localize action based on 3D convolution features. A
video is first divided into equal length clips and for each clip a set of tube
proposals are generated next based on 3D Convolutional Network (ConvNet)
features. Finally, the tube proposals of different clips are linked together
employing network flow and spatio-temporal action detection is performed using
these linked video proposals. Extensive experiments on several video datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of T-CNN for classifying and localizing
actions in both trimmed and untrimmed videos compared to state-of-the-arts.

649,"Expropriations, Property Confiscations and New Offshore Entities: Evidence from the Panama Papers","  Using the Panama Papers, we show that the beginning of media reporting on
expropriations and property confiscations in a country increases the
probability that offshore entities are incorporated by agents from the same
country in the same month. This result is robust to the use of country-year
fixed effects and the exclusion of tax havens. Further analysis shows that the
effect is driven by countries with non-corrupt and effective governments, which
supports the notion that offshore entities are incorporated when reasonably
well-intended and well-functioning governments become more serious about
fighting organized crime by confiscating proceeds of crime.

650,Revealing Hidden Potentials of the q-Space Signal in Breast Cancer,"  Mammography screening for early detection of breast lesions currently suffers
from high amounts of false positive findings, which result in unnecessary
invasive biopsies. Diffusion-weighted MR images (DWI) can help to reduce many
of these false-positive findings prior to biopsy. Current approaches estimate
tissue properties by means of quantitative parameters taken from generative,
biophysical models fit to the q-space encoded signal under certain assumptions
regarding noise and spatial homogeneity. This process is prone to fitting
instability and partial information loss due to model simplicity. We reveal
unexplored potentials of the signal by integrating all data processing
components into a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is
designed to propagate clinical target information down to the raw input images.
This approach enables simultaneous and target-specific optimization of image
normalization, signal exploitation, global representation learning and
classification. Using a multicentric data set of 222 patients, we demonstrate
that our approach significantly improves clinical decision making with respect
to the current state of the art.

651,Concave Flow on Small Depth Directed Networks,"  Small depth networks arise in a variety of network related applications,
often in the form of maximum flow and maximum weighted matching. Recent works
have generalized such methods to include costs arising from concave functions.
In this paper we give an algorithm that takes a depth $D$ network and strictly
increasing concave weight functions of flows on the edges and computes a $(1 -
\epsilon)$-approximation to the maximum weight flow in time $mD \epsilon^{-1}$
times an overhead that is logarithmic in the various numerical parameters
related to the magnitudes of gradients and capacities.
Our approach is based on extending the scaling algorithm for approximate
maximum weighted matchings by [Duan-Pettie JACM`14] to the setting of small
depth networks, and then generalizing it to concave functions. In this more
restricted setting of linear weights in the range $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$, it
produces a $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation in time $O(mD \epsilon^{-1} \log(
w_{\max} /w_{\min}))$. The algorithm combines a variety of tools and provides a
unified approach towards several problems involving small depth networks.

652,Knowledge Management Strategies and Processes in Agile Software Development: A Systematic Literature Review,"  Knowledge-intensive companies that adopt Agile Software Development (ASD)
relay on efficient implementation of Knowledge Management (KM) strategies to
promotes different Knowledge Processes (KPs) to gain competitive advantage.
This study aims to explore how companies that adopt ASD implement KM strategies
utilizing practices that promote the KPs in the different organizational
layers. Through a systematic literature review, we analyzed 32 primary studies,
selected by automated search and snowballing in the extant literature. To
analyze the data, we applied narrative synthesis. Most of the identified KM
practices implement personalization strategies (81 %), supported by
codification (19 %). Our review shows that the primary studies do not report KM
practices in the strategic layer and two of them in the product portfolio
layer; on the other hand, in the project layer, the studies report 33 practices
that implement personalization strategy, and seven practices that implement
codification. KM strategies in ASD promote mainly the knowledge transfer
process with practices that stimulate social interaction to share tacit
knowledge in the project layer. As a result of using informal communication, a
significant amount of knowledge can be lost or not properly transferred to
other individuals and, instead of propagating the knowledge, it remains inside
a few individuals minds.

653,A supernova at 50 pc: Effects on the Earth's atmosphere and biota,"  Recent 60Fe results have suggested that the estimated distances of supernovae
in the last few million years should be reduced from 100 pc to 50 pc. Two
events or series of events are suggested, one about 2.7 million years to 1.7
million years ago, and another may at 6.5 to 8.7 million years ago. We ask what
effects such supernovae are expected to have on the terrestrial atmosphere and
biota. Assuming that the Local Bubble was formed before the event being
considered, and that the supernova and the Earth were both inside a weak,
disordered magnetic field at that time, TeV-PeV cosmic rays at Earth will
increase by a factor of a few hundred. Tropospheric ionization will increase
proportionately, and the overall muon radiation load on terrestrial organisms
will increase by a factor of 150. All return to pre-burst levels within 10kyr.
In the case of an ordered magnetic field, effects depend strongly on the field
orientation. The upper bound in this case is with a largely coherent field
aligned along the line of sight to the supernova, in which case TeV-PeV cosmic
ray flux increases are 10^4; in the case of a transverse field they are below
current levels. We suggest a substantial increase in the extended effects of
supernovae on Earth and in the lethal distance estimate; more work is
needed.This paper is an explicit followup to Thomas et al. (2016). We also here
provide more detail on the computational procedures used in both works.

film thickness and the concentration of soap solution. We perform this
measurement by measuring the curvature of the nylon wires that bound the soap
film channel and use the measured curvature to parametrize the relation between
the surface tension and the tension of the wire. We find the surface tension of
our soap films increases when the film is relatively thin or made of soap
solution of low concentration, otherwise it approaches an asymptotic value 30
mN/m. A simple adsorption model with only two parameters describes our
observations reasonably well. With our measurements, we are also able to
measure Gibbs elasticity for our soap film.

655,Plugo: a VLC Systematic Perspective of Large-scale Indoor Localization,"  Indoor localization based on Visible Light Communication (VLC) has been in
favor with both the academia and industry for years. In this paper, we present
a prototyping photodiode-based VLC system towards large-scale localization.
Specially, we give in-depth analysis of the design constraints and
considerations for large-scale indoor localization research. After that we
identify the key enablers for such systems: 1) distributed architecture, 2)
one-way communication, and 3) random multiple access. Accordingly, we propose
Plugo -- a photodiode-based VLC system conforming to the aforementioned
criteria. We present a compact design of the VLC-compatible LED bulbs featuring
plug-and-go use-cases. The basic framed slotted Additive Links On-line Hawaii
Area (ALOHA) is exploited to achieve random multiple access over the shared
optical medium. We show its effectiveness in beacon broadcasting by
experiments, and further demonstrate its scalability to large-scale scenarios
through simulations. Finally, preliminary localization experiments are
conducted using fingerprinting-based methods in a customized testbed, achieving
an average accuracy of 0.14 m along with a 90-percentile accuracy of 0.33 m.

with an appropriate prior over the weights and biases is a Gaussian process
(GP) in the limit of infinitely many convolutional filters, extending similar
results for dense networks. For a CNN, the equivalent kernel can be computed
exactly and, unlike ""deep kernels"", has very few parameters: only the
hyperparameters of the original CNN. Further, we show that this kernel has two
properties that allow it to be computed efficiently; the cost of evaluating the
kernel for a pair of images is similar to a single forward pass through the
original CNN with only one filter per layer. The kernel equivalent to a
32-layer ResNet obtains 0.84% classification error on MNIST, a new record for
GPs with a comparable number of parameters.

657,FluxMarker: Enhancing Tactile Graphics with Dynamic Tactile Markers,"  For people with visual impairments, tactile graphics are an important means
to learn and explore information. However, raised line tactile graphics created
with traditional materials such as embossing are static. While available
refreshable displays can dynamically change the content, they are still too
expensive for many users, and are limited in size. These factors limit
wide-spread adoption and the representation of large graphics or data sets. In
this paper, we present FluxMaker, an inexpensive scalable system that renders
dynamic information on top of static tactile graphics with movable tactile
markers. These dynamic tactile markers can be easily reconfigured and used to
annotate static raised line tactile graphics, including maps, graphs, and
diagrams. We developed a hardware prototype that actuates magnetic tactile
markers driven by low-cost and scalable electromagnetic coil arrays, which can
be fabricated with standard printed circuit board manufacturing. We evaluate
our prototype with six participants with visual impairments and found positive
results across four application areas: location finding or navigating on
tactile maps, data analysis, and physicalization, feature identification for
tactile graphics, and drawing support. The user study confirms advantages in
application domains such as education and data exploration.

Such statements vary in the degree of certainty the author expresses toward the
outcome:""Leonardo DiCaprio will win Best Actor"" vs. ""Leonardo DiCaprio may win""
or ""No way Leonardo wins!"". Can popular beliefs on social media predict who
will win? To answer this question, we build a corpus of tweets annotated for
veridicality on which we train a log-linear classifier that detects positive
veridicality with high precision. We then forecast uncertain outcomes using the
wisdom of crowds, by aggregating users' explicit predictions. Our method for
forecasting winners is fully automated, relying only on a set of contenders as
input. It requires no training data of past outcomes and outperforms sentiment
and tweet volume baselines on a broad range of contest prediction tasks. We
further demonstrate how our approach can be used to measure the reliability of
individual accounts' predictions and retrospectively identify surprise

660,SLAM-Assisted Coverage Path Planning for Indoor LiDAR Mapping Systems,"  Applications involving autonomous navigation and planning of mobile agents
can benefit greatly by employing online Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) techniques, however, their proper implementation still warrants an
efficient amalgamation with any offline path planning method that may be used
for the particular application. In this paper, such a case of amalgamation is
considered for a LiDAR-based indoor mapping system which presents itself as a
2D coverage path planning problem implemented along with online SLAM. This
paper shows how classic offline Coverage Path Planning (CPP) can be altered for
use with online SLAM by proposing two modifications: (i) performing convex
decomposition of the polygonal coverage area to allow for an arbitrary choice
of an initial point while still tracing the shortest coverage path and (ii)
using a new approach to stitch together the different cells within the
polygonal area to form a continuous coverage path. Furthermore, an alteration
to the SLAM operation to suit the coverage path planning strategy is also made
that evaluates navigation errors in terms of an area coverage cost function.
The implementation results show how the combination of the two modified offline
and online planning strategies allow for an improvement in the total area
coverage by the mapping system - the modification thus presents an approach for
modifying offline and online navigation strategies for robust operation.

shared, but difficulty persists in rapidly accessing the most crucial
information. Previous surveys have focused on the methodologies of sports video
analysis from the spatiotemporal viewpoint instead of a content-based
viewpoint, and few of these studies have considered semantics. This study
develops a deeper interpretation of content-aware sports video analysis by
examining the insight offered by research into the structure of content under
different scenarios. On the basis of this insight, we provide an overview of
the themes particularly relevant to the research on content-aware systems for
broadcast sports. Specifically, we focus on the video content analysis
techniques applied in sportscasts over the past decade from the perspectives of
fundamentals and general review, a content hierarchical model, and trends and
challenges. Content-aware analysis methods are discussed with respect to
object-, event-, and context-oriented groups. In each group, the gap between
sensation and content excitement must be bridged using proper strategies. In
this regard, a content-aware approach is required to determine user demands.
Finally, the paper summarizes the future trends and challenges for sports video
analysis. We believe that our findings can advance the field of research on
content-aware video analysis for broadcast sports.

the light-matter interaction in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers. We
have performed a detailed investigation of the ""spin-forbidden"" dark excitons

is partially coupled to light with z polarization (""grey"" exciton). The first
determination of the dark neutral exciton lifetime $\tau_D$ in a transition
metal dichalcogenide monolayer is obtained by time-resolved photoluminescence.
We measure $\tau_D \sim 110 \pm 10$ ps for the grey exciton state, i.e. two
orders of magnitude longer than the radiative lifetime of the bright neutral
exciton at T=12 K.

667,Learning a Predictive Model for Music Using PULSE,"  Predictive models for music are studied by researchers of algorithmic
composition, the cognitive sciences and machine learning. They serve as base
models for composition, can simulate human prediction and provide a
multidisciplinary application domain for learning algorithms. A particularly
well established and constantly advanced subtask is the prediction of
monophonic melodies. As melodies typically involve non-Markovian dependencies
their prediction requires a capable learning algorithm. In this thesis, I apply
the recent feature discovery and learning method PULSE to the realm of symbolic
music modeling. PULSE is comprised of a feature generating operation and
L1-regularized optimization. These are used to iteratively expand and cull the
feature set, effectively exploring feature spaces that are too large for common
feature selection approaches. I design a general Python framework for PULSE,
propose task-optimized feature generating operations and various
music-theoretically motivated features that are evaluated on a standard corpus
of monophonic folk and chorale melodies. The proposed method significantly
outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models. I further discuss the free
parameters of the learning algorithm and analyze the feature composition of the
learned models. The models learned by PULSE afford an easy inspection and are
musicologically interpreted for the first time.

contribution is an unfolding algorithm that uses a new notion of independence
to avoid redundant transformer application, thread-local fixed points to reduce
the size of the unfolding, and a novel cutoff criterion based on subsumption to
guarantee termination of the analysis. Our experiments show that the abstract
unfolding produces an order of magnitude fewer false alarms than a mature
abstract interpreter, while being several orders of magnitude faster than
solver-based tools that have the same precision.

670,Perturbation theory for cosmologies with non-linear structure,"  The next generation of cosmological surveys will operate over unprecedented
scales, and will therefore provide exciting new opportunities for testing
general relativity. The standard method for modelling the structures that these
surveys will observe is to use cosmological perturbation theory for linear
structures on horizon-sized scales, and Newtonian gravity for non-linear
structures on much smaller scales. We propose a two-parameter formalism that
generalizes this approach, thereby allowing interactions between large and
small scales to be studied in a self-consistent and well-defined way. This uses
both post-Newtonian gravity and cosmological perturbation theory, and can be
used to model realistic cosmological scenarios including matter, radiation and
a cosmological constant. We find that the resulting field equations can be
written as a hierarchical set of perturbation equations. At leading-order,
these equations allow us to recover a standard set of Friedmann equations, as
well as a Newton-Poisson equation for the inhomogeneous part of the Newtonian
energy density in an expanding background. For the perturbations in the
large-scale cosmology, however, we find that the field equations are sourced by
both non-linear and mode-mixing terms, due to the existence of small-scale
structures. These extra terms should be expected to give rise to new
gravitational effects, through the mixing of gravitational modes on small and
large scales - effects that are beyond the scope of standard linear
cosmological perturbation theory. We expect our formalism to be useful for
accurately modelling gravitational physics in universes that contain non-linear
structures, and for investigating the effects of non-linear gravity in the era
of ultra-large-scale surveys.

672,Amortized Inference Regularization,"  The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular model for density estimation
and representation learning. Canonically, the variational principle suggests to
prefer an expressive inference model so that the variational approximation is
accurate. However, it is often overlooked that an overly-expressive inference
model can be detrimental to the test set performance of both the amortized
posterior approximator and, more importantly, the generative density estimator.
In this paper, we leverage the fact that VAEs rely on amortized inference and
propose techniques for amortized inference regularization (AIR) that control
the smoothness of the inference model. We demonstrate that, by applying AIR, it
is possible to improve VAE generalization on both inference and generative
performance. Our paper challenges the belief that amortized inference is simply
a mechanism for approximating maximum likelihood training and illustrates that
regularization of the amortization family provides a new direction for
understanding and improving generalization in VAEs.

673,Phase Synchronization on Spacially Embeded Duplex Networks with Total Cost Constraint,"  Synchronization on multiplex networks have attracted increasing attention in
the past few years. We investigate collective behaviors of Kuramoto oscillators
on single layer and duplex spacial networks with total cost restriction, which
was introduced by Li et. al [Li G., Reis S. D., Moreira A. A., Havlin S.,
Stanley H. E. and Jr A. J., {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} 104, 018701 (2010)] and
termed as the Li network afterwards. In the Li network model, with the increase
of its spacial exponent, the network's structure will vary from the random type
to the small-world one, and finally to the regular lattice.We first explore how
the spacial exponent influences the synchronizability of Kuramoto oscillators
on single layer Li networks and find that the closer the Li network is to a
regular lattice, the more difficult for it to evolve into synchronization. Then
we investigate synchronizability of duplex Li networks and find that the
existence of inter-layer interaction can greatly enhance inter-layer and global
synchronizability. When the inter-layer coupling strength is larger than a
certain critical value, whatever the intra-layer coupling strength is, the
inter-layer synchronization will always occur. Furthermore, on single layer Li
networks, nodes with larger degrees more easily reach global synchronization,
while on duplex Li networks, this phenomenon becomes much less obvious.
Finally, we study the impact of inter-link density on global synchronization
and obtain that sparse inter-links can lead to the emergence of global
synchronization for duplex Li networks just as dense inter-links do. In a word,
inter-layer interaction plays a vital role in determining synchronizability for
duplex spacial networks with total cost constraint.

674,Excited states of defect lines in silicon: A first-principles study based on hydrogen cluster analogues,"  Excited states of a single donor in bulk silicon have previously been studied
extensively based on effective mass theory. However, a proper theoretical
description of the excited states of a donor cluster is still scarce. Here we
study the excitations of lines of defects within a single-valley spherical band
approximation, thus mapping the problem to a scaled hydrogen atom array. A
series of detailed full configuration-interaction and time-dependent hybrid
density-functional theory calculations have been performed to understand linear
clusters of up to 10 donors. Our studies illustrate the generic features of
their excited states, addressing the competition between formation of
inter-donor ionic states and intra-donor atomic excited states. At short
inter-donor distances, excited states of donor molecules are dominant, at
intermediate distances ionic states play an important role, and at long
distances the intra-donor excitations are predominant as expected. The
calculations presented here emphasise the importance of correlations between
donor electrons, and are thus complementary to other recent approaches that
include effective mass anisotropy and multi-valley effects. The exchange
splittings between relevant excited states have also been estimated for a donor
pair and for a three-donor arrays; the splittings are much larger than those in
the ground state in the range of donor separations between 10 and 20 nm. This
establishes a solid theoretical basis for the use of excited-state exchange
interactions for controllable quantum gate operations in silicon.

(hereafter [C I] (1$-$0) and [C I] (2$-$1), respectively) and the CO (1$-$0)
line for a sample of (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies [(U)LIRGs]. We explore
the correlations between the luminosities of CO (1$-$0) and [C I] lines, and
find that $L'_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$ correlates almost linearly with both $L'_
\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$ and $L'_\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$, suggesting that [C I] lines
can trace total molecular gas mass at least for (U)LIRGs. We also investigate
the dependence of $L'_\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$/$L'_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$,
$L'_\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$/$L'_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$ and
$L'_\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$/$L'_\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$ on the far-infrared color of
60-to-100 $\mu$m, and find non-correlation, a weak correlation and a modest
correlation, respectively. Under the assumption that these two carbon
transitions are optically thin, we further calculate the [C I] line excitation
temperatures, atomic carbon masses, and the mean [C I] line flux-to-H$_2$ mass
conversion factors for our sample. The resulting $\mathrm{H_2}$ masses using
these [C I]-based conversion factors roughly agree with those derived from
$L'_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$ and CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor.

677,Stochastic Ratcheting on a Funneled Energy Landscape is Necessary for Highly Efficient Contractility of Actomyosin Force Dipoles,"  Current understanding of how contractility emerges in disordered actomyosin
networks of non-muscle cells is still largely based on the intuition derived
from earlier works on muscle contractility. This view, however, largely
overlooks the free energy gain following passive cross-linker binding, which,
even in the absence of active fluctuations, provides a thermodynamic drive
towards highly overlapping filamentous states. In this work, we shed light on
this phenomenon, showing that passive cross-linkers, when considered in the
context of two anti-parallel filaments, generate noticeable contractile forces.
However, as binding free energy of cross-linkers is increased, a sharp onset of
kinetic arrest follows, greatly diminishing effectiveness of this contractility
mechanism, allowing the network to contract only with weakly resisting tensions
at its boundary. We have carried out stochastic simulations elucidating this
mechanism, followed by a mean-field treatment that predicts how contractile
forces asymptotically scale at small and large binding energies, respectively.
Furthermore, when considering an active contractile filament pair, based on
non-muscle myosin II, we found that the non-processive nature of these motors
leads to highly inefficient force generation, due to recoil slippage of the
overlap during periods when the motor is dissociated. However, we discovered
that passive cross-linkers can serve as a structural ratchet during these
unbound motor time spans, resulting in vast force amplification. Our results
shed light on the non-equilibrium effects of transiently binding proteins in
biological active matter, as observed in the non-muscle actin cytoskeleton,
showing that highly efficient contractile force dipoles result from synergy of
passive cross-linker and active motor dynamics, via a ratcheting mechanism on a
funneled energy landscape.

massive MIMO for cost-efficient implementation makes them more prone to
hardware imperfections such as phase noise (PN). As a result, we focus on a
realistic broadcast channel with a large number of antennas and hampered by the
unavoidable PN. Moreover, we employ the RS transmission strategy, and we show
its robustness against PN, since the sum-rate does not saturate at high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although, the analytical results are obtained by
means of the deterministic equivalent analysis, they coincide with simulation
results even for finite system dimensions.

679,Tangle-tree duality in abstract separation systems,"  We prove a general width duality theorem for combinatorial structures with
well-defined notions of cohesion and separation. These might be graphs and
matroids, but can be much more general or quite different. The theorem asserts
a duality between the existence of high cohesiveness somewhere local and a
global overall tree structure.
We describe cohesive substructures in a unified way in the format of tangles:
as orientations of low-order separations satisfying certain consistency axioms.
These axioms can be expressed without reference to the underlying structure,
such as a graph or matroid, but just in terms of the poset of the separations
themselves. This makes it possible to identify tangles, and apply our
tangle-tree duality theorem, in very diverse settings.
Our result implies all the classical duality theorems for width parameters in
graph minor theory, such as path-width, tree-width, branch-width or rank-width.
It yields new, tangle-type, duality theorems for tree-width and path-width. It
implies the existence of width parameters dual to cohesive substructures such
as $k$-blocks, edge-tangles, or given subsets of tangles, for which no width
duality theorems were previously known.
Abstract separation systems can be found also in structures quite unlike
graphs and matroids. For example, our theorem can be applied to image analysis
by capturing the regions of an image as tangles of separations defined as
natural partitions of its set of pixels. It can be applied in big data contexts
by capturing clusters as tangles. It can be applied in the social sciences,
e.g. by capturing as tangles the few typical mindsets of individuals found by a
survey. It could also be applied in pure mathematics, e.g. to separations of
compact manifolds.

680,Attention-Based Guided Structured Sparsity of Deep Neural Networks,"  Network pruning is aimed at imposing sparsity in a neural network
architecture by increasing the portion of zero-valued weights for reducing its
size regarding energy-efficiency consideration and increasing evaluation speed.
In most of the conducted research efforts, the sparsity is enforced for network
pruning without any attention to the internal network characteristics such as
unbalanced outputs of the neurons or more specifically the distribution of the
weights and outputs of the neurons. That may cause severe accuracy drop due to
uncontrolled sparsity. In this work, we propose an attention mechanism that
simultaneously controls the sparsity intensity and supervised network pruning
by keeping important information bottlenecks of the network to be active. On
CIFAR-10, the proposed method outperforms the best baseline method by 6% and
reduced the accuracy drop by 2.6x at the same level of sparsity.

681,A Graph Model with Indirect Co-location Links,"  Graph models are widely used to analyse diffusion processes embedded in
social contacts and to develop applications. A range of graph models are
available to replicate the underlying social structures and dynamics
realistically. However, most of the current graph models can only consider
concurrent interactions among individuals in the co-located interaction
networks. However, they do not account for indirect interactions that can
transmit spreading items to individuals who visit the same locations at
different times but within a certain time limit. The diffusion phenomena
occurring through direct and indirect interactions is called same place
different time (SPDT) diffusion. This paper introduces a model to synthesize
co-located interaction graphs capturing both direct interactions, where
individuals meet at a location, and indirect interactions, where individuals
visit the same location at different times within a set timeframe. We analyze
60 million location updates made by 2 million users from a social networking
application to characterize the graph properties, including the space-time
correlations and its time evolving characteristics, such as bursty or ongoing
behaviors. The generated synthetic graph reproduces diffusion dynamics of a
realistic contact graph, and reduces the prediction error by up to 82% when
compare to other contact graph models demonstrating its potential for
forecasting epidemic spread.

682,Essentially No Barriers in Neural Network Energy Landscape,"  Training neural networks involves finding minima of a high-dimensional
non-convex loss function. Knowledge of the structure of this energy landscape
is sparse. Relaxing from linear interpolations, we construct continuous paths
between minima of recent neural network architectures on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.
Surprisingly, the paths are essentially flat in both the training and test
landscapes. This implies that neural networks have enough capacity for
structural changes, or that these changes are small between minima. Also, each
minimum has at least one vanishing Hessian eigenvalue in addition to those
resulting from trivial invariance.

elliptic systems with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The growth
and the coercivity of the elliptic operator is assumed to be indicated by a
general inhomogeneous anisotropic $N-$function, which may be possibly also
dependent on the spatial variable, i.e., the homogenization process will change
the characteristic function spaces at each step. Such a problem is well known
and there exists many positive results for the function satisfying $\Delta_2$
and $\nabla_2$ conditions an being in addition HÃƒÂ¶lder continuous with
respect to the spatial variable. We shall show that cases these conditions can
be neglected and will deal with a rather general problem in general function

semiactive suspension system with time-varying delays. In this system, road
profile information is downloaded from a cloud database to facilitate onboard
estimation of suspension states. Time-varying data transmission delays are
considered and assumed to be bounded. A quarter-car linear suspension model is
used and an H-infinity filter is designed with both onboard sensor measurements
and delayed road profile information from the cloud. The filter design
procedure is designed based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical
simulation results are reported that illustrates the fusion of cloud-based and
on-board information that can be achieved in Vehicleto- Cloud-to-Vehicle

that we are able to perform exact and efficient inference on a densely

Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRFs). Our method, called VideoGCRF is (a)
efficient, (b) has a unique global minimum, and (c) can be trained end-to-end
alongside contemporary deep networks for video understanding. We experiment
with multiple connectivity patterns in the temporal domain, and present
empirical improvements over strong baselines on the tasks of both semantic and

687,Approximating the Backbone in the Weighted Maximum Satisfiability Problem,"  The weighted Maximum Satisfiability problem (weighted MAX-SAT) is a NP-hard
problem with numerous applications arising in artificial intelligence. As an
efficient tool for heuristic design, the backbone has been applied to
heuristics design for many NP-hard problems. In this paper, we investigated the
computational complexity for retrieving the backbone in weighted MAX-SAT and
developed a new algorithm for solving this problem. We showed that it is
intractable to retrieve the full backbone under the assumption that . Moreover,
it is intractable to retrieve a fixed fraction of the backbone as well. And
then we presented a backbone guided local search (BGLS) with Walksat operator
for weighted MAX-SAT. BGLS consists of two phases: the first phase samples the
backbone information from local optima and the backbone phase conducts local
search under the guideline of backbone. Extensive experimental results on the
benchmark showed that BGLS outperforms the existing heuristics in both solution
quality and runtime.

688,Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in spin-orbit-coupled superconductors,"  We show that in the presence of magnetic field, two superconducting phases
with the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pair parallel to the magnetic field
are induced in spin-orbit-coupled superconductor Li$_2$Pd$_3$B. Specifically,
at small magnetic field, the center-of-mass momentum is induced due to the
energy-spectrum distortion and no unpairing region with vanishing singlet
correlation appears. We refer to this superconducting state as the drift-BCS
state. By further increasing the magnetic field, the superconducting state
falls into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state with the emergence of the
unpairing regions. The observed abrupt enhancement of the center-of-mass
momenta and suppression on the order parameters during the crossover indicate
the first-order phase transition. Enhanced Pauli limit and hence enlarged
magnetic-field regime of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, due to the
spin-flip terms of the spin-orbit coupling, are revealed. We also address the
triplet correlations induced by the spin-orbit coupling, and show that the
Cooper-pair spin polarizations, generated by the magnetic field and
center-of-mass momentum with the triplet correlations, exhibit totally
different magnetic-field dependences between the drift-BCS and
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states.

690,Geometric Insights into Support Vector Machine Behavior using the KKT Conditions,"  The support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful and widely used classification
algorithm. This paper uses the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to provide
rigorous mathematical proof for new insights into the behavior of SVM. These
insights provide perhaps unexpected relationships between SVM and two other
linear classifiers: the mean difference and the maximal data piling direction.
For example, we show that in many cases SVM can be viewed as a cropped version
of these classifiers. By carefully exploring these connections we show how SVM
tuning behavior is affected by characteristics including: balanced vs.
unbalanced classes, low vs. high dimension, separable vs. non-separable data.
These results provide further insights into tuning SVM via cross-validation by
explaining observed pathological behavior and motivating improved
cross-validation methodology. Finally, we also provide new results on the
geometry of complete data piling directions in high dimensional space.

In the context of Smart Grids (SG), the collection of vast amounts of data has
seen the emergence of a plethora of data analysis approaches. In this paper, we
conduct a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) aimed at getting insights about
different facets of SG data analysis: application sub-domains (e.g., power load
control), aspects covered (e.g., forecasting), used techniques (e.g.,
clustering), tool-support, research methods (e.g., experiments/simulations),
replicability/reproducibility of research. The final goal is to provide a view
of the current status of research. Overall, we found that each sub-domain has
its peculiarities in terms of techniques, approaches and research methodologies
applied. Simulations and experiments play a crucial role in many areas. The
replicability of studies is limited concerning the provided implemented
algorithms, and to a lower extent due to the usage of private datasets.

692,On the K-theory of C*-algebras for substitution tilings (a pedestrian version),"  Under suitable conditions, a substitution tiling gives rise to a Smale space,
from which three equivalence relations can be constructed, namely the stable,
unstable, and asymptotic equivalence relations. We denote with $S$, $U$, and
$A$ their corresponding $C^*$-algebras in the sense of Renault. In this article
we show that the $K$-theories of $S$ and $U$ can be computed from the
cohomology and homology of a single cochain complex with connecting maps for
tilings of the line and of the plane. Moreover, we provide formulas to compute
the $K$-theory for these three $C^*$-algebras. Furthermore, we show that the
$K$-theory groups for tilings of dimension 1 are always torsion free. For
tilings of dimension 2, only $K_0(U)$ and $K_1(S)$ can contain torsion.

693,The Tutte embedding of the mated-CRT map converges to Liouville quantum gravity,"  We prove that the Tutte embeddings (a.k.a. harmonic/embeddings) of certain
random planar maps converge to $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity
($\gamma$-LQG). Specifically, we treat mated-CRT maps, which are discretized
matings of correlated continuum random trees, and $\gamma$ ranges from $0$ to
$2$ as one varies the correlation parameter. We also show that the associated
space-filling path on the embedded map converges to space-filling
SLE$_{\kappa}$ for $\kappa =16/\gamma^2$ (in the annealed sense) and that
simple random walk on the embedded map converges to Brownian motion (in the
quenched sense). Our arguments also yield analogous statements for the Smith
(square tiling) embedding of the mated-CRT map.
This work constitutes the first proof that a discrete conformal embedding of
a random planar map converges to LQG. Many more such statements have been
conjectured. Since the mated-CRT map can be viewed as a coarse-grained
approximation to other random planar maps (the UIPT, tree-weighted maps,
bipolar-oriented maps, etc.), our results indicate a potential approach for
proving that embeddings of these maps converge to LQG as well.
To prove the main result, we establish several (independently interesting)
theorems about LQG surfaces decorated by space-filling SLE. There is a natural
way to use the SLE curve to divide the plane into `cells' corresponding to
vertices of the mated-CRT map. We study the law of the shape of the
origin-containing cell, in particular proving moments for the ratio of its
squared diameter to its area. We also give bounds on the degree of the
origin-containing cell and establish a form of ergodicity for the entire
configuration. Ultimately, we use these properties to show (using a general
theorem proved in a separate paper) that random walk on these cells converges
to a time change of Brownian motion, which in turn leads to the Tutte embedding
result.

694,On the Computation of the Shannon Capacity of a Discrete Channel with Noise,"  Muroga [M52] showed how to express the Shannon channel capacity of a discrete
channel with noise [S49] as an explicit function of the transition
probabilities. His method accommodates channels with any finite number of input
symbols, any finite number of output symbols and any transition probability
matrix. Silverman [S55] carried out Muroga's method in the special case of a
binary channel (and went on to analyse ""cascades"" of several such binary
channels).
This article is a note on the resulting formula for the capacity C(a, c) of a
single binary channel. We aim to clarify some of the arguments and correct a
small error. In service of this aim, we first formulate several of Shannon's
definitions and proofs in terms of discrete measure-theoretic probability
theory. We provide an alternate proof to Silverman's, of the feasibility of the
optimal input distribution for a binary channel. For convenience, we also
express C(a, c) in a single expression explicitly dependent on a and c only,
which Silverman stopped short of doing.

696,Compositional Human Pose Regression,"  Regression based methods are not performing as well as detection based
methods for human pose estimation. A central problem is that the structural
information in the pose is not well exploited in the previous regression
methods. In this work, we propose a structure-aware regression approach. It
adopts a reparameterized pose representation using bones instead of joints. It
exploits the joint connection structure to define a compositional loss function
that encodes the long range interactions in the pose. It is simple, effective,
and general for both 2D and 3D pose estimation in a unified setting.
Comprehensive evaluation validates the effectiveness of our approach. It
significantly advances the state-of-the-art on Human3.6M and is competitive
with state-of-the-art results on MPII.

697,Stochastic functional differential equations and sensitivity to their initial path,"  We consider systems with memory represented by stochastic functional
differential equations. Substantially, these are stochastic differential
equations with coefficients depending on the past history of the process
itself. Such coefficients are hence defined on a functional space. Models with
memory appear in many applications ranging from biology to finance. Here we
consider the results of some evaluations based on these models (e.g. the prices
of some financial products) and the risks connected to the choice of these
models. In particular we focus on the impact of the initial condition on the
evaluations. This problem is known as the analysis of sensitivity to the
initial condition and, in the terminology of finance, it is referred to as the
Delta. In this work the initial condition is represented by the relevant past
history of the stochastic functional differential equation. This naturally
leads to the redesign of the definition of Delta. We suggest to define it as a
functional directional derivative, this is a natural choice. For this we study
a representation formula which allows for its computation without requiring
that the evaluation functional is differentiable. This feature is particularly
relevant for applications. Our formula is achieved by studying an appropriate
relationship between Malliavin derivative and functional directional
derivative. For this we introduce the technique of {\it randomisation of the
initial condition}.

699,A Stochastic Model for File Lifetime and Security in Data Center Networks,"  Data center networks are an important infrastructure in various applications
of modern information technologies. Note that each data center always has a
finite lifetime, thus once a data center fails, then it will lose all its
storage files and useful information. For this, it is necessary to replicate
and copy each important file into other data centers such that this file can
increase its lifetime of staying in a data center network. In this paper, we
describe a large-scale data center network with a file d-threshold policy,
which is to replicate each important file into at most d-1 other data centers
such that this file can maintain in the data center network under a given level
of data security in the long-term. To this end, we develop three relevant
Markov processes to propose two effective methods for assessing the file
lifetime and data security. By using the RG-factorizations, we show that the
two methods are used to be able to more effectively evaluate the file lifetime
of large-scale data center networks. We hope the methodology and results given
in this paper are applicable in the file lifetime study of more general data
center networks with replication mechanism.

701,A Theoretical Perspective of Solving Phaseless Compressed Sensing via Its Nonconvex Relaxation,"  As a natural extension of compressive sensing and the requirement of some
practical problems, Phaseless Compressed Sensing (PCS) has been introduced and
studied recently. Many theoretical results have been obtained for PCS with the
aid of its convex relaxation. Motivated by successful applications of nonconvex
relaxed methods for solving compressive sensing, in this paper, we try to
investigate PCS via its nonconvex relaxation. Specifically, we relax PCS in the
real context by the corresponding $\ell_p$-minimization with $p\in (0,1)$. We
show that there exists a constant $p^\ast\in (0,1]$ such that for any fixed
$p\in(0, p^\ast)$, every optimal solution to the $\ell_p$-minimization also
solves the concerned problem; and derive an expression of such a constant
$p^\ast$ by making use of the known data and the sparsity level of the
concerned problem. These provide a theoretical basis for solving this class of
problems via the corresponding $\ell_p$-minimization.

702,A Comprehensive Study of Ly$ÃŽÂ±$ Emission in the High-redshift Galaxy Population,"  We present an exhaustive census of Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission in the
general galaxy population at $3<z<4.6$. We use the Michigan/Magellan Fiber
System (M2FS) spectrograph to study a stellar mass (M$_*$) selected sample of
625 galaxies homogeneously distributed in the range
$7.6<\log{\mbox{M$_*$/M$_{\odot}$}}<10.6$. Our sample is selected from the
3D-HST/CANDELS survey, which provides the complementary data to estimate
Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths ($W_{Ly\alpha}$) and escape fractions ($f_{esc}$)
for our galaxies. We find both quantities to anti-correlate with M$_*$,
star-formation rate (SFR), UV luminosity, and UV slope ($\beta$). We then model
the $W_{Ly\alpha}$ distribution as a function of M$_{UV}$ and $\beta$ using a
Bayesian approach. Based on our model and matching the properties of typical
Lyman break galaxy (LBG) selections, we conclude that the $W_{Ly\alpha}$
distribution in such samples is heavily dependent on the limiting M$_{UV}$ of
the survey. Regarding narrowband surveys, we find their $W_{Ly\alpha}$
selections to bias samples toward low M$_*$, while their line-flux limitations
preferentially leave out low-SFR galaxies. We can also use our model to predict
the fraction of Ly$\alpha$-emitting LBGs at $4\leqslant z\leqslant 7$. We show
that reported drops in the Ly$\alpha$ fraction at $z\geqslant6$, usually
attributed to the rapidly increasing neutral gas fraction of the universe, can
also be explained by survey M$_{UV}$ incompleteness. This result does not
dismiss reionization occurring at $z\sim7$, but highlights that current data is
not inconsistent with this process taking place at $z>7$.

transaction costs in the hedging portfolio by proposing a cost proportional to
the amount of assets traded and the traded price. After deriving the nonlinear
PDE, we prove the existence of a solution for the corresponding
initial-boundary value problem. Moreover, we develop a numerical scheme that
allows to find the solution of the PDE by setting different values for each
parameter of the model. To understand the impact of each variable within the
model, we analyze the Greeks of the option and the sensitivity of the price to
changes in all the risk factors.

704,"Market Self-Learning of Signals, Impact and Optimal Trading: Invisible Hand Inference with Free Energy","  We present a simple model of a non-equilibrium self-organizing market where
asset prices are partially driven by investment decisions of a bounded-rational
agent. The agent acts in a stochastic market environment driven by various
exogenous ""alpha"" signals, agent's own actions (via market impact), and noise.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, our agent aggregates all traders in the
market, rather than being a representative agent. Therefore, it can be
identified with a bounded-rational component of the market itself, providing a
particular implementation of an Invisible Hand market mechanism. In such
setting, market dynamics are modeled as a fictitious self-play of such
bounded-rational market-agent in its adversarial stochastic environment. As
rewards obtained by such self-playing market agent are not observed from market
data, we formulate and solve a simple model of such market dynamics based on a
neuroscience-inspired Bounded Rational Information Theoretic Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (BRIT-IRL). This results in effective asset price
dynamics with a non-linear mean reversion - which in our model is generated
dynamically, rather than being postulated. We argue that our model can be used
in a similar way to the Black-Litterman model. In particular, it represents, in
a simple modeling framework, market views of common predictive signals, market
impacts and implied optimal dynamic portfolio allocations, and can be used to
assess values of private signals. Moreover, it allows one to quantify a
""market-implied"" optimal investment strategy, along with a measure of market
rationality. Our approach is numerically light, and can be implemented using
standard off-the-shelf software such as TensorFlow.

also any party changes between one period and the next. The real voting power
is measured by considering power indices from cooperative game theory, which
are based on the capability of the political parties to form winning
coalitions. With this approach, we can do an analysis that goes beyond the

707,The risk of contagion spreading and its optimal control in the economy,"  The global crisis of 2008 provoked a heightened interest among scientists to
study the phenomenon, its propagation and negative consequences. The process of
modelling the spread of a virus is commonly used in epidemiology. Conceptually,
the spread of a disease among a population is similar to the contagion process
in economy. This similarity allows considering the contagion in the world
financial system using the same mathematical model of infection spread that is
often used in epidemiology. Our research focuses on the dynamic behaviour of
contagion spreading in the global financial network. The effect of infection by
a systemic spread of risks in the network of national banking systems of
countries is tested. An optimal control problem is then formulated to simulate
a control that may avoid significant financial losses. The results show that
the proposed approach describes well the reality of the world economy, and
emphasizes the importance of international relations between countries on the
financial stability.

in financial economics. We approach the usual caveats of probabilistic
forecasts studies -small samples, limited models and non-holistic validations-
by performing a comprehensive comparison of 15 predictive schemes during a time
period of over 21 years. All densities are evaluated in terms of their
statistical consistency, local accuracy and forecasting errors. Using a new
composite indicator, the Integrated Forecast Score (IFS), we show that
risk-neutral densities outperform historical-based predictions in terms of
information content. We find that the Variance Gamma model generates the
highest out-of-sample likelihood of observed prices and the lowest predictive
errors, whereas the ARCH-based GJR-FHS delivers the most consistent forecasts
across the entire density range. In contrast, lognormal densities, the Heston
model or the Breeden-Litzenberger formula yield biased predictions and are
rejected in statistical tests.

seen the introduction of two new techniques. One is the Bootstrapped Selective
Predictability Scheme (SPSb), which can provide quantitative forecasts of the
Gross Domestic Product of countries. The other, Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
regularisation, denoises the datasets typically employed in the literature. We
contribute to EC along three different directions. First, we prove the
convergence of the SPSb algorithm to a well-known statistical learning
technique known as Nadaraya-Watson Kernel regression. The latter has
significantly lower time complexity, produces deterministic results, and it is
interchangeable with SPSb for the purpose of making predictions. Second, we
study the effects of HMM regularization on the Product Complexity and logPRODY
metrics, for which a model of time evolution has been recently proposed. We
find confirmation for the original interpretation of the logPRODY model as
describing the change in the global market structure of products with new
insights allowing a new interpretation of the Complexity measure, for which we
propose a modification. Third, we explore new effects of regularisation on the
data. We find that it reduces noise, and observe for the first time that it
increases nestedness in the export network adjacency matrix.

billion spent on ads by 575 regular advertisers over a five-year period,
approximately 37% of all ad spend measured between 2008 and 2012. Inclusion of
brand/quarter fixed effects and industry/week fixed effects brings parameter
estimates closer to expectations without major reductions in estimation
precision. The findings indicate that (i) national traditional ads increase
perceived quality, perceived value, and recent satisfaction; (ii) local
traditional ads increase perceived quality and perceived value; (iii) digital
ads increase perceived value; and (iv) competitor ad effects are generally
negative.

711,Day-ahead electricity price forecasting with high-dimensional structures: Univariate vs. multivariate modeling frameworks,"  We conduct an extensive empirical study on short-term electricity price
forecasting (EPF) to address the long-standing question if the optimal model
structure for EPF is univariate or multivariate. We provide evidence that
despite a minor edge in predictive performance overall, the multivariate
modeling framework does not uniformly outperform the univariate one across all
12 considered datasets, seasons of the year or hours of the day, and at times
is outperformed by the latter. This is an indication that combining advanced
structures or the corresponding forecasts from both modeling approaches can
bring a further improvement in forecasting accuracy. We show that this indeed
can be the case, even for a simple averaging scheme involving only two models.
Finally, we also analyze variable selection for the best performing
high-dimensional lasso-type models, thus provide guidelines to structuring
better performing forecasting model designs.

Markov processes together with their transition probabilities can be
interpreted as Markov cubature rules. The polynomial property allows us to
study such rules using algebraic techniques. Markov cubature rules aid the

714,Critical factors and enablers of food quality and safety compliance risk management in the Vietnamese seafood supply chain,"  Recently, along with the emergence of food scandals, food supply chains have
to face with ever-increasing pressure from compliance with food quality and
safety regulations and standards. This paper aims to explore critical factors
of compliance risk in food supply chain with an illustrated case in Vietnamese
seafood industry. To this end, this study takes advantage of both primary and
secondary data sources through a comprehensive literature research of
industrial and scientific papers, combined with expert interview. Findings
showed that there are three main critical factor groups influencing on
compliance risk including challenges originating from Vietnamese food supply
chain itself, characteristics of regulation and standards, and business
environment. Furthermore, author proposed enablers to eliminate compliance
risks to food supply chain managers as well as recommendations to government

Interpolating interest rates between maturities in the discrete tenor structure
is equivalent to extending the model to continuous tenor. The present paper
sets forth an alternative way of performing this extension; one which preserves
the Markovian properties of the discrete tenor models and guarantees the
positivity of all interpolated rates.

the comonotonic setting provides a lower bound to the price of debt under
Eisenberg-Noe financial networks with consistent marginal endowments. Such
financial networks encode the interconnection of firms through debt claims. The
proposed pricing formulas consider the realized, endogenous, recovery rate on
debt claims. Special consideration will be given to the setting in which firms

717,Optimal Timing of Decisions: A General Theory Based on Continuation Values,"  Building on insights of Jovanovic (1982) and subsequent authors, we develop a
comprehensive theory of optimal timing of decisions based around continuation
value functions and operators that act on them. Optimality results are provided
under general settings, with bounded or unbounded reward functions. This
approach has several intrinsic advantages that we exploit in developing the
theory. One is that continuation value functions are smoother than value
functions, allowing for sharper analysis of optimal policies and more efficient
computation. Another is that, for a range of problems, the continuation value
function exists in a lower dimensional space than the value function,
mitigating the curse of dimensionality. In one typical experiment, this reduces
the computation time from over a week to less than three minutes.

article describes how pristine was defined based on expectations of Bennu and
on a realistic understanding of what is achievable with a constrained schedule
and budget, and how that definition flowed to requirements and implementation.
To return a pristine sample, the OSIRIS- REx spacecraft sampling hardware was
maintained at level 100 A/2 and <180 ng/cm2 of amino acids and hydrazine on the
sampler head through precision cleaning, control of materials, and vigilance.
Contamination is further characterized via witness material exposed to the
spacecraft assembly and testing environment as well as in space. This
characterization provided knowledge of the expected background and will be used
in conjunction with archived spacecraft components for comparison with the
samples when they are delivered to Earth for analysis. Most of all, the
cleanliness of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft was achieved through communication
among scientists, engineers, managers, and technicians.

719,Curse of Heterogeneity: Computational Barriers in Sparse Mixture Models and Phase Retrieval,"  We study the fundamental tradeoffs between statistical accuracy and
computational tractability in the analysis of high dimensional heterogeneous
data. As examples, we study sparse Gaussian mixture model, mixture of sparse
linear regressions, and sparse phase retrieval model. For these models, we
exploit an oracle-based computational model to establish conjecture-free
computationally feasible minimax lower bounds, which quantify the minimum
signal strength required for the existence of any algorithm that is both
computationally tractable and statistically accurate. Our analysis shows that
there exist significant gaps between computationally feasible minimax risks and
classical ones. These gaps quantify the statistical price we must pay to
achieve computational tractability in the presence of data heterogeneity. Our
results cover the problems of detection, estimation, support recovery, and
clustering, and moreover, resolve several conjectures of Azizyan et al. (2013,
2015); Verzelen and Arias-Castro (2017); Cai et al. (2016). Interestingly, our
results reveal a new but counter-intuitive phenomenon in heterogeneous data
analysis that more data might lead to less computation complexity.

720,Modality Attention for End-to-End Audio-visual Speech Recognition,"  Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) system is thought to be one of the
most promising solutions for robust speech recognition, especially in noisy
environment. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal attention based
method for audio-visual speech recognition which could automatically learn the
fused representation from both modalities based on their importance. Our method
is realized using state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq)
architectures. Experimental results show that relative improvements from 2% up
to 36% over the auditory modality alone are obtained depending on the different
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Compared to the traditional feature concatenation
methods, our proposed approach can achieve better recognition performance under
both clean and noisy conditions. We believe modality attention based end-to-end
method can be easily generalized to other multimodal tasks with correlated
information.

722,When flux standards go wild: white dwarfs in the age of Kepler,"  White dwarf stars have been used as flux standards for decades, thanks to
their staid simplicity. We have empirically tested their photometric stability
by analyzing the light curves of 398 high-probability candidates and
spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs observed during the original Kepler
mission and later with K2 Campaigns 0-8. We find that the vast majority (>97
per cent) of non-pulsating and apparently isolated white dwarfs are stable to
better than 1 per cent in the Kepler bandpass on 1-hr to 10-d timescales,
confirming that these stellar remnants are useful flux standards. From the
cases that do exhibit significant variability, we caution that binarity,
magnetism, and pulsations are three important attributes to rule out when
establishing white dwarfs as flux standards, especially those hotter than
30,000 K.

ordered sets (posets) and compare it to the well known theory for quivers. In
particular, we prove that every indecomposable representation of a poset of
finite type is stable with respect to some weight and construct that weight
explicitly in terms of the dimension vector. We show that if a poset is
primitive then Coxeter transformations preserve stable representations. When
the base field is the field of complex numbers we establish the connection
between the polystable representations and the unitary $\chi$-representations
of posets. This connection explains the similarity of the results obtained in
the series of papers.

724,Automatic segmentation of trees in dynamic outdoor environments,"  Segmentation in dynamic outdoor environments can be difficult when the
illumination levels and other aspects of the scene cannot be controlled.
Specifically in orchard and vineyard automation contexts, a background material
is often used to shield a camera's field of view from other rows of crops. In
this paper, we describe a method that uses superpixels to determine low texture
regions of the image that correspond to the background material, and then show
how this information can be integrated with the color distribution of the image
to compute optimal segmentation parameters to segment objects of interest.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the suitability of this
approach for dynamic outdoor environments, specifically for tree reconstruction
and apple flower detection applications.

725,Dynamic Security Analysis of Power Systems by a Sampling-Based Algorithm,"  Dynamic security analysis is an important problem of power systems on
ensuring safe operation and stable power supply even when certain faults occur.
No matter such faults are caused by vulnerabilities of system components,
physical attacks, or cyber-attacks that are more related to cyber-security,
they eventually affect the physical stability of a power system. Examples of
the loss of physical stability include the Northeast blackout of 2003 in North
America and the 2015 system-wide blackout in Ukraine. The nonlinear hybrid
nature, that is, nonlinear continuous dynamics integrated with discrete
switching, and the high degree of freedom property of power system dynamics
make it challenging to conduct the dynamic security analysis. In this paper, we
use the hybrid automaton model to describe the dynamics of a power system and
mainly deal with the index-1 differential-algebraic equation models regarding
the continuous dynamics in different discrete states. The analysis problem is
formulated as a reachability problem of the associated hybrid model. A
sampling-based algorithm is then proposed by integrating modeling and
randomized simulation of the hybrid dynamics to search for a feasible execution
connecting an initial state of the post-fault system and a target set in the
desired operation mode. The proposed method enables the use of existing power
system simulators for the synthesis of discrete switching and control
strategies through randomized simulation. The effectiveness and performance of
the proposed approach are demonstrated with an application to the dynamic
security analysis of the New England 39-bus benchmark power system exhibiting
hybrid dynamics. In addition to evaluating the dynamic security, the proposed
method searches for a feasible strategy to ensure the dynamic security of the
system in face of disruptions.

726,Stochastic and Chance-Constrained Conic Distribution System Expansion Planning Using Bilinear Benders Decomposition,"  Second order conic programming (SOCP) has been used to model various
applications in power systems, such as operation and expansion planning. In
this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic mixed integer SOCP (MISOCP) model
for the distribution system expansion planning problem that considers
uncertainty and also captures the nonlinear AC power flow. To avoid costly
investment plans due to some extreme scenarios, we further present a
chance-constrained variant that could lead to cost-effective solutions. To
address the computational challenge, we extend the basic Benders decomposition
method and develop a bilinear variant to compute stochastic and
chance-constrained MISOCP formulations. A set of numerical experiments is
performed to illustrate the performance of our models and computational
methods. In particular, results show that our Benders decomposition algorithms
drastically outperform a professional MISOCP solver in handling stochastic
scenarios by orders of magnitude.

time-translating gateways, respectively, and analyze their performance with
respect to the number of layers and the delay variations through simulations.
The simulation results demonstrate that the time synchronization performance of
the packet relaying, which has lower complexity, is close to that of

teach scientific content. We measured the effectiveness of introductory lab
courses at achieving this educational goal across nine different lab courses at
three very different institutions. These institutions and courses encompassed a
broad range of student populations and instructional styles. The nine courses
studied had two key things in common: the labs aimed to reinforce the content
presented in lectures, and the labs were optional. By comparing the performance
of students who did and did not take the labs (with careful normalization for
selection effects), we found universally and precisely no added value to
learning from taking the labs as measured by course exam performance. This work
should motivate institutions and departments to reexamine the goals and conduct
of their lab courses, given their resource-intensive nature. We show why these
results make sense when looking at the comparative mental processes of students
involved in research and instructional labs, and offer alternative goals and
instructional approaches that would make lab courses more educationally
valuable.

729,Smoothed Noise and Mexican Hat Coupling Produce Pattern in a Stochastic Neural Field,"  The formation of pattern in biological systems may be modeled by a set of
reaction-diffusion equations. A diffusion-type coupling operator biologically
significant in neuroscience is a difference of Gaussian functions (Mexican Hat
operator) used as a spatial-convolution kernel. We are interested in the
difference among behaviors of \emph{stochastic} neural field equations, namely
space-time stochastic differential-integral equations, and similar
deterministic ones. We explore, quantitatively, how the parameters of our model
that measure the shape of the coupling kernel, coupling strength, and aspects
of the spatially-smoothed space-time noise, control the pattern in the
resulting evolving random field. We find that a spatial pattern that is damped
in time in a deterministic system may be sustained and amplified by
stochasticity, most strikingly at an optimal spatio-temporal noise level. In
addition, we find that spatially-smoothed noise alone causes pattern formation
even without spatial coupling.

730,ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture; increasing shape bias improves accuracy and robustness,"  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly thought to recognise
objects by learning increasingly complex representations of object shapes. Some
recent studies suggest a more important role of image textures. We here put
these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and
human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that
ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather
than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and
reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate
that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based
representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation
instead when trained on ""Stylized-ImageNet"", a stylized version of ImageNet.
This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our
well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560
psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of
unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and
previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions,
highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.

fragments of (i) First Order Logic with the canonical Herbrand interpretation
and (ii) Separation Logic, respectively. Inspired by classical
automata-theoretic techniques of proving language inclusion between tree
automata, we give a small set of inference rules, that are proved to be sound
and complete, under certain semantic restrictions, involving the set of
constraints in the inductive system. Moreover, we investigate the decidability
and computational complexity of these restrictions for all the logical
fragments considered and provide a proof search semi-algorithm that becomes a
decision procedure for the entailment problem, for those systems that fulfill
the restrictions.

733,HybridNet: Classification and Reconstruction Cooperation for Semi-Supervised Learning,"  In this paper, we introduce a new model for leveraging unlabeled data to
improve generalization performances of image classifiers: a two-branch

supervision signal and is dedicated to the extraction of invariant
class-related representations. The second branch is fully unsupervised and
dedicated to model information discarded by the first branch to reconstruct
input data. To further support the expected behavior of our model, we propose
an original training objective. It favors stability in the discriminative
branch and complementarity between the learned representations in the two
branches. HybridNet is able to outperform state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10,
SVHN and STL-10 in various semi-supervised settings. In addition,
visualizations and ablation studies validate our contributions and the behavior
of the model on both CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets.

NLP tasks with ease. We train the model using a large corpus of texts and their
entity annotations extracted from Wikipedia. We evaluated the model on three
important NLP tasks (i.e., sentence textual similarity, entity linking, and
factoid question answering) involving both unsupervised and supervised
settings. As a result, we achieved state-of-the-art results on all three of
these tasks. Our code and trained models are publicly available for further

unordered $n$ points on the Riemann sphere is a quotient space of the Zariski
open set $K_n$ of $\mathbb C^{n-3}$ by an $S_n$ action. The stabilizers of this
$S_n$ action at certain points of this Zariski open set $K_n$ correspond to the
groups fixing the sets of $n$ points on the Riemann sphere. Let $\alpha$ be a
subset of $n$ distinct points on the Riemann sphere. We call the group of all
linear fractional transformations leaving $\alpha$ invariant the stabilizer of
$\alpha$, which is finite by observation. For each non-trivial finite subgroup
$G$ of the group ${\rm PSL}(2,{\Bbb C})$ of linear fractional transformations,
we give the necessary and sufficient condition for finite subsets of the
Riemann sphere under which the stabilizers of them are conjugate to $G$. We
also prove that there does exist some finite subset of the Riemann sphere whose
stabilizer coincides with $G$. Next we obtain the irreducible decompositions of
the representations of the stabilizers on the tangent spaces at the
singularities of $\mathfrak{M_{0,\:n}}$. At last, on $\mathfrak{M_{0,\:5}}$ and
$\mathfrak{M_{0,\:6}}$, we work out explicitly the singularities and the
representations of their stabilizers on the tangent spaces at them.

736,Multipath Error Correction in Radio Interferometric Positioning Systems,"  The radio interferometric positioning system (RIPS) is an accurate node
localization method featuring a novel phase-based ranging process. Multipath is
the limiting error source for RIPS in ground-deployed scenarios or indoor
applications. There are four distinct channels involved in the ranging process
for RIPS. Multipath reflections affect both the phase and amplitude of the
ranging signal for each channel. By exploiting untapped amplitude information,
we put forward a scheme to estimate each channel's multipath profile, which is
then subsequently used to correct corresponding errors in phase measurements.
Simulations show that such a scheme is very effective in reducing multipath
phase errors, which are essentially brought down to the level of receiver noise
under moderate multipath conditions. It is further demonstrated that ranging
errors in RIPS are also greatly reduced via the proposed scheme.

738,Monitoring Telluric Absorption with CAMAL,"  Ground-based astronomical observations may be limited by telluric water vapor
absorption, which is highly variable in time and significantly complicates both
spectroscopy and photometry in the near-infrared (NIR). To achieve the
sensitivity required to detect Earth-sized exoplanets in the NIR, simultaneous
monitoring of precipitable water vapor (PWV) becomes necessary to mitigate the
impact of variable telluric lines on radial velocity measurements and transit
light curves. To address this issue, we present the Camera for the Automatic
Monitoring of Atmospheric Lines (CAMAL), a stand-alone, inexpensive six-inch
aperture telescope dedicated to measuring PWV at the Fred Lawrence Whipple
Observatory on Mount Hopkins. CAMAL utilizes three narrowband NIR filters to
trace the amount of atmospheric water vapor affecting simultaneous observations
with the MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) and MINERVA-Red
telescopes. Here we present the current design of CAMAL, discuss our data
analysis methods, and show results from 11 nights of PWV measurements taken
with CAMAL. For seven nights of data, we have independent PWV measurements
extracted from high-resolution stellar spectra taken with the Tillinghast
Reflector Echelle Spectrometer (TRES) also located on Mount Hopkins. We use the
TRES spectra to calibrate the CAMAL absolute PWV scale. Comparisons between
CAMAL and TRES PWV estimates show excellent agreement, matching to within 1 mm
over a 10 mm range in PWV. Analysis of CAMAL's photometric precision propagates
to PWV measurements precise to better than 0.5 mm in dry (PWV < 4 mm)
conditions. We also find that CAMAL-derived PWVs are highly correlated with
those from a GPS-based water vapor monitor located approximately 90 km away at
Kitt Peak National Observatory, with a root mean square PWV difference of 0.8
mm.

739,Common Knowledge in a Logic of Gossips,"  Gossip protocols aim at arriving, by means of point-to-point or group
communications, at a situation in which all the agents know each other secrets.
Recently a number of authors studied distributed epistemic gossip protocols.
These protocols use as guards formulas from a simple epistemic logic, which
makes their analysis and verification substantially easier.
We study here common knowledge in the context of such a logic. First, we
analyze when it can be reduced to iterated knowledge. Then we show that the
semantics and truth for formulas without nested common knowledge operator are
decidable. This implies that implementability, partial correctness and
termination of distributed epistemic gossip protocols that use non-nested
common knowledge operator is decidable, as well. Given that common knowledge is
equivalent to an infinite conjunction of nested knowledge, these results are
non-trivial generalizations of the corresponding decidability results for the
original epistemic logic, established in (Apt & Wojtczak, 2016).

740,Network-theoretic approach to sparsified discrete vortex dynamics,"  We examine discrete vortex dynamics in two-dimensional flow through a
network-theoretic approach. The interaction of the vortices is represented with
a graph, which allows the use of network-theoretic approaches to identify key
vortex-to-vortex interactions. We employ sparsification techniques on these
graph representations based on spectral theory for constructing sparsified
models and evaluating the dynamics of vortices in the sparsified setup.
Identification of vortex structures based on graph sparsification and sparse
vortex dynamics are illustrated through an example of point-vortex clusters
interacting amongst themselves. We also evaluate the performance of
sparsification with increasing number of point vortices. The
sparsified-dynamics model developed with spectral graph theory requires reduced
number of vortex-to-vortex interactions but agrees well with the full nonlinear
dynamics. Furthermore, the sparsified model derived from the sparse graphs
conserves the invariants of discrete vortex dynamics. We highlight the
similarities and differences between the present sparsified-dynamics model and
the reduced-order models.

741,Symmetries of handlebodies and their fixed points: Dihedral extended Schottky groups,"  A Schottky structure on a handlebody $M$ of genus $g$ is provided by a
Schottky group of rank $g$. A symmetry (an orientation-reversing involution) of
$M$ is known to have at most $(g+1)$ connected components of fixed points. Each
of these components is either a point or a compact bordered surface (either
orientable or not) whose boundary is contained in the border of $M$. In this
paper, we derive sharp upper bounds for the total number of connected
components of the sets of fixed points of given two or three symmetries of $M$.
In order to obtain such an upper bound, we obtain a geometrical structure
description of those extended Kleinian groups $K$ containing a Schottky group
$\Gamma$ as finite index normal subgroup so that $K/\Gamma$ is a dihedral group
(called dihedral Schottky groups). Our upper bounds turn out to be different to
the corresponding ones at the level of closed Riemann surfaces. In contrast to
the case of Riemann surfaces, we observe that $M$ cannot have two different
maximal symmetries.

c-GaN/sapphire templates using a CVD technique, where pure indium and ammonia
are used as metal and nitrogen precursors. A systematic study of the growth,
structural and electronic properties of these samples shows a preferential
growth of the islands along [11-20] and [0001] directions leading to the

Inclined facets of these walls are identified as r-planes [(1-102)-planes] of
wurtzite InN. Onset of absorption for these samples is observed to be higher
than the band gap of InN suggesting a high background carrier concentration in
this material. Study of the valence band edge through XPS indicates the
formation of positive depletion regions below the r-plane side facets of the
walls. This is in contrast with the observation for c-plane InN epilayers,
where electron accumulation is often reported below the top surface.

744,Enhanced version of AdaBoostM1 with J48 Tree learning method,"  Machine Learning focuses on the construction and study of systems that can
learn from data. This is connected with the classification problem, which
usually is what Machine Learning algorithms are designed to solve. When a
machine learning method is used by people with no special expertise in machine
learning, it is important that the method be robust in classification, in the
sense that reasonable performance is obtained with minimal tuning of the
problem at hand. Algorithms are evaluated based on how robust they can classify
the given data. In this paper, we propose a quantifiable measure of robustness,
and describe a particular learning method that is robust according to this
measure in the context of classification problem. We proposed Adaptive Boosting
(AdaBoostM1) with J48(C4.5 tree) as a base learner with tuning weight threshold
(P) and number of iterations (I) for boosting algorithm. To benchmark the
performance, we used the baseline classifier, AdaBoostM1 with Decision Stump as
base learner without tuning parameters. By tuning parameters and using J48 as
base learner, we are able to reduce the overall average error rate ratio
(errorC/errorNB) from 2.4 to 0.9 for development sets of data and 2.1 to 1.2

citizens may possibly decide to modify their individual tax compliance
according to individual criteria, such as, the strength of their ethical
commitment, the satisfaction gained by consumption of the public good and the
perceived opinion of neighbors. Results show the presence of thresholds levels
in the composition of society - between taxpayers and evaders - which explain
the extent of damages deriving from tax evasion.

746,Variability response functions for statically determinate beams with arbitrary nonlinear constitutive laws,"  The variability response function (VRF) is generalized to statically
determinate Euler Bernoulli beams with arbitrary stress-strain laws following
Cauchy elastic behavior. The VRF is a Green's function that maps the spectral
density function (SDF) of a statistically homogeneous random field describing
the correlation structure of input uncertainty to the variance of a response
quantity. The appeal of such Green's functions is that the variance can be
determined for any correlation structure by a trivial computation of a
convolution integral. The method introduced in this work derives VRFs in closed
form for arbitrary nonlinear Cauchy-elastic constitutive laws and is
demonstrated through three examples. It is shown why and how higher order
spectra of the random field affect the response variance for nonlinear
constitutive laws. In the general sense, the VRF for a statically determinate
beam is found to be a matrix kernel whose inner product by a matrix of higher
order SDFs and statistical moments is integrated to give the response variance.
The resulting VRF matrix is unique regardless of the random field's marginal
probability density function (PDF) and SDFs.

747,Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation for Batch Normalized Deep Networks,"  We show that training a deep network using batch normalization is equivalent
to approximate inference in Bayesian models. We further demonstrate that this
finding allows us to make meaningful estimates of the model uncertainty using
conventional architectures, without modifications to the network or the
training procedure. Our approach is thoroughly validated by measuring the
quality of uncertainty in a series of empirical experiments on different tasks.
It outperforms baselines with strong statistical significance, and displays
competitive performance with recent Bayesian approaches.

748,Computing Simple Multiple Zeros of Polynomial Systems,"  Given a polynomial system f associated with a simple multiple zero x of
multiplicity {\mu}, we give a computable lower bound on the minimal distance
between the simple multiple zero x and other zeros of f. If x is only given
with limited accuracy, we propose a numerical criterion that f is certified to
have {\mu} zeros (counting multiplicities) in a small ball around x.
Furthermore, for simple double zeros and simple triple zeros whose Jacobian is
of normalized form, we define modified Newton iterations and prove the
quantified quadratic convergence when the starting point is close to the exact
simple multiple zero. For simple multiple zeros of arbitrary multiplicity whose
Jacobian matrix may not have a normalized form, we perform unitary
transformations and modified Newton iterations, and prove its non-quantified
quadratic convergence and its quantified convergence for simple triple zeros.

749,Refracting Metasurfaces without Spurious Diffraction,"  Refraction represents one of the most fundamental operations that may be
performed by a metasurface. However, simple phasegradient metasurface designs
suffer from restricted angular deflection due to spurious diffraction orders.
It has been recently shown, using a circuit-based approach, that refraction
without spurious diffraction, or diffraction-free, can fortunately be achieved
by a transverse metasurface exhibiting either loss-gain or bianisotropy. Here,
we rederive these conditions using a medium-based - and hence more insightfull
- approach based on Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) and surface
susceptibility tensors, and experimentally demonstrate two diffraction-free
refractive metasurfaces that are essentially lossless, passive, bianisotropic
and reciprocal.

750,Accurate Motion Estimation through Random Sample Aggregated Consensus,"  We reconsider the classic problem of estimating accurately a 2D
transformation from point matches between images containing outliers. RANSAC
discriminates outliers by randomly generating minimalistic sampled hypotheses
and verifying their consensus over the input data. Its response is based on the
single hypothesis that obtained the largest inlier support. In this article we
show that the resulting accuracy can be improved by aggregating all generated
hypotheses. This yields RANSAAC, a framework that improves systematically over
RANSAC and its state-of-the-art variants by statistically aggregating
hypotheses. To this end, we introduce a simple strategy that allows to rapidly
average 2D transformations, leading to an almost negligible extra computational
cost. We give practical applications on projective transforms and
homography+distortion models and demonstrate a significant performance gain in
both cases.

accurate, fully conservative, finite element discretization of the nonlinear
multi-species Landau integral with adaptive mesh refinement using the PETSc
library (www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc). We develop algorithms and techniques to
efficiently utilize emerging architectures with an approach that minimizes
memory usage and movement and is suitable for vector processing. The Landau

sustains as much as 22% of the theoretical peak flop rate of the Second

752,Faster Tensor Canonicalization,"  The Butler-Portugal algorithm for obtaining the canonical form of a tensor
expression with respect to slot symmetries and dummy-index renaming suffers, in
certain cases with a high degree of symmetry, from $O(n!)$ explosion in both
computation time and memory. We present a modified algorithm which alleviates
this problem in the most common cases---tensor expressions with subsets of
indices which are totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric---in polynomial
time. We also present an implementation of the label-renaming mechanism which
improves upon that of the original Butler-Portugal algorithm, thus providing a
significant speed increase for the average case as well as the highly-symmetric
special case. The worst-case behavior remains $O(n!)$, although it occurs in
more limited situations unlikely to appear in actual computations. We comment
on possible strategies to take if the nature of a computation should make these
situations more likely.

753,Mass Preconditioning for the Exact One-Flavor Action in Lattice QCD with Domain-Wall Fermion,"  The mass-preconditioning (MP) technique has become a standard tool to enhance
the efficiency of the hybrid Monte-Carlo simulation (HMC) of lattice QCD with
dynamical quarks, for 2-flavors QCD with degenerate quark masses, as well as
its extension to the case of one-flavor by taking the square-root of the
fermion determinant of 2-flavors with degenerate masses. However, for lattice
QCD with domain-wall fermion, the fermion determinant of any single fermion
flavor can be expressed as a functional integral with an exact pseudofermion
action $ \phi^\dagger H^{-1} \phi $, where $ H^{-1} $ is a positive-definite
Hermitian operator without taking square-root, and with the chiral structure
\cite{Chen:2014hyy}. Consequently, the mass-preconditioning for the exact
one-flavor action (EOFA) does not necessarily follow the conventional (old) MP
pattern. In this paper, we present a new mass-preconditioning for the EOFA,
which is more efficient than the old MP which we have used in Refs.
\cite{Chen:2014hyy,Chen:2014bbc}. We perform numerical tests in lattice QCD
with $ N_f = 1 $ and $ N_f = 1+1+1+1 $ optimal domain-wall quarks, with one
mass-preconditioner applied to one of the exact one-flavor actions, and we find
that the efficiency of the new MP is more than 20\% higher than that of the old
MP.

754,Finite-time scaling at the Anderson transition for vibrations in solids,"  A model in which a three-dimensional elastic medium is represented by a
network of identical masses connected by springs of random strengths and
allowed to vibrate only along a selected axis of the reference frame, exhibits
an Anderson localization transition. To study this transition, we assume that
the dynamical matrix of the network is given by a product of a sparse random
matrix with real, independent, Gaussian-distributed non-zero entries and its
transpose. A finite-time scaling analysis of system's response to an initial
excitation allows us to estimate the critical parameters of the localization
transition. The critical exponent is found to be $\nu = 1.57 \pm 0.02$ in
agreement with previous studies of Anderson transition belonging to the
three-dimensional orthogonal universality class.

755,Weighted Low Rank Approximation for Background Estimation Problems,"  Classical principal component analysis (PCA) is not robust to the presence of
sparse outliers in the data. The use of the $\ell_1$ norm in the Robust PCA
(RPCA) method successfully eliminates the weakness of PCA in separating the
sparse outliers. In this paper, by sticking a simple weight to the Frobenius
norm, we propose a weighted low rank (WLR) method to avoid the often
computationally expensive algorithms relying on the $\ell_1$ norm. As a proof
of concept, a background estimation model has been presented and compared with
two $\ell_1$ norm minimization algorithms. We illustrate that as long as a
simple weight matrix is inferred from the data, one can use the weighted
Frobenius norm and achieve the same or better performance.

degeneracy of left- and right-circularly polarized spin waves. This
relativistic coupling increases the efficiency of spin-wave-induced domain wall
motion and leads to higher drift velocities. We show that in biaxial
antiferromagnets, the spin-wave helicity controls both the direction and
magnitude of the magnonic force on chiral domain walls. By contrast, in
uniaxial antiferromagnets, the magnonic force is propulsive with a helicity
dependent strength.

757,The Spatial Shape of Avalanches,"  In disordered elastic systems, driven by displacing a parabolic confining
potential adiabatically slowly, all advance of the system is in bursts, termed
avalanches. Avalanches have a finite extension in time, which is much smaller
than the waiting-time between them. Avalanches also have a finite extension
$\ell$ in space, i.e. only a part of the interface of size $\ell$ moves during
an avalanche. Here we study their spatial shape $\left< S(x)\right>_{\ell}$
given $\ell$, as well as its fluctuations encoded in the second cumulant
$\left< S^{2}(x)\right>_{\ell}^{\rm c}$. We establish scaling relations
governing the behavior close to the boundary. We then give analytic results for
the Brownian force model, in which the microscopic disorder for each degree of
freedom is a random walk. Finally, we confirm these results with numerical
simulations. To do this properly we elucidate the influence of discretization
effects, which also confirms the assumptions entering into the scaling ansatz.
This allows us to reach the scaling limit already for avalanches of moderate
size. We find excellent agreement for the universal shape, its fluctuations,
including all amplitudes.

758,Multiple Topological Electronic Phases in Superconductor MoC,"  The search for a superconductor with non-s-wave pairing is important not only
for understanding unconventional mechanisms of superconductivity but also for
finding new types of quasiparticles such as Majorana bound states. Materials
with both topological band structure and superconductivity are promising
candidates as $p+ip$ superconducting states can be generated through pairing
the spin-polarized topological surface states. In this work, the electronic and
phonon properties of the superconductor molybdenum carbide (MoC) are studied
with first-principles methods. Our calculations show that nontrivial band
topology and superconductivity coexist in both structural phases of MoC,
namely, the cubic $\alpha$ and hexagonal $\gamma$ phases. The $\alpha$ phase is
a strong topological insulator and the $\gamma$ phase is a topological nodal
line semimetal with drumhead surface states. In addition, hole doping can
stabilize the crystal structure of the $\alpha$ phase and elevate the
transition temperature in the $\gamma$ phase. Therefore, MoC in different
structural forms can be a practical material platform for studying topological
superconductivity and elusive Majorana fermions.

759,Extension complexity of stable set polytopes of bipartite graphs,"  The extension complexity $\mathsf{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$ is the minimum
number of facets of a polytope that affinely projects to $P$. Let $G$ be a
bipartite graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and no isolated vertices. Let
$\mathsf{STAB}(G)$ be the convex hull of the stable sets of $G$. It is easy to
see that $n \leqslant \mathsf{xc} (\mathsf{STAB}(G)) \leqslant n+m$. We improve
both of these bounds. For the upper bound, we show that $\mathsf{xc}
(\mathsf{STAB}(G))$ is $O(\frac{n^2}{\log n})$, which is an improvement when
$G$ has quadratically many edges. For the lower bound, we prove that
$\mathsf{xc} (\mathsf{STAB}(G))$ is $\Omega(n \log n)$ when $G$ is the
incidence graph of a finite projective plane. We also provide examples of
$3$-regular bipartite graphs $G$ such that the edge vs stable set matrix of $G$
has a fooling set of size $|E(G)|$.

760,Performance Scaling Law for Multi-Cell Multi-User Massive MIMO,"  This work provides a comprehensive scaling law based performance analysis for
multi-cell multi-user massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) downlink
systems. Imperfect channel state information (CSI), pilot contamination, and
channel spatial correlation are all considered. First, a sum- rate lower bound
is derived by exploiting the asymptotically deterministic property of the
received signal power, while keeping the random nature of other components in
the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) intact. Via a general
scaling model on important network parameters, including the number of users,
the channel training energy and the data transmission power, with respect to
the number of base station antennas, the asymptotic scaling law of the
effective SINR is obtained, which reveals quantitatively the tradeoff of the
network parameters. More importantly, pilot contamination and pilot
contamination elimination (PCE) are considered in the analytical framework. In
addition, the applicability of the derived asymptotic scaling law in practical
systems with large but finite antenna numbers are discussed. Finally,
sufficient conditions on the parameter scalings for the SINR to be
asymptotically deterministic in the sense of mean square convergence are
provided, which covers existing results on such analysis as special cases and
shows the effect of PCE explicitly.

761,On the Status of the Measurement Problem: Recalling the Relativistic Transactional Interpretation,"  In view of a resurgence of concern about the measurement problem, it is
pointed out that the Relativistic Transactional Interpretation (RTI) remedies
issues previously considered as drawbacks or refutations of the original TI.
Specifically, once one takes into account relativistic processes that are not
representable at the non-relativistic level (such as particle creation and
annihilation, and virtual propagation), absorption is quantitatively defined in
unambiguous physical terms. In addition, specifics of the relativistic
transactional model demonstrate that the Maudlin `contingent absorber'
challenge to the original TI cannot even be mounted: basic features of
established relativistic field theories (in particular, the asymmetry between
field sources and the bosonic fields, and the fact that slow-moving bound
states, such as atoms, are not offer waves) dictate that the `slow-moving offer
wave' required for the challenge scenario cannot exist. It is concluded that
issues previously considered obstacles for TI are no longer legitimately viewed
as such, and that reconsideration of the transactional picture is warranted in
connection with solving the measurement problem.

$\beta$-$\mathrm{Li_2IrO_3}$, a hyperhoneycomb iridate in proximity to a Kitaev
quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals a
reconstruction of the electronic ground state below 2 GPa, the same pressure
range where x-ray magnetic circular dichroism shows an apparent collapse of
magnetic order. The electronic reconstruction, which manifests a reduction in
the effective spin-orbit (SO) interaction in $5d$ orbitals, pushes
$\beta$-$\mathrm{Li_2IrO_3}$ further away from the pure $J_{\rm eff}=1/2$
limit. Although lattice symmetry is preserved across the electronic transition,
x-ray diffraction shows a highly anisotropic compression of the hyperhoneycomb
lattice which affects the balance of bond-directional Ir-Ir exchange
interactions driven by spin-orbit coupling at Ir sites. An enhancement of
symmetric anisotropic exchange over Kitaev and Heisenberg exchange interactions
seen in theoretical calculations that use precisely this anisotropic Ir-Ir bond
compression provides one possible route to realization of a QSL state in this
hyperhoneycomb iridate at high pressures.

variables discounted by a multiplicative random walk is called perpetuity,
because of a possible actuarial application. We give three disjoint groups of
sufficient conditions which ensure that the distribution right tail of a
perpetuity $\mathbb{P}\{X>x\}$ is asymptotic to $ax^ce^{-bx}$ as $x\to\infty$
for some $a,b>0$ and $c\in\mathbb{R}$. Our results complement those of Denisov
and Zwart [J. Appl. Probab. 44 (2007), 1031--1046]. As an auxiliary tool we
provide criteria for the finiteness of the one-sided exponential moments of
perpetuities. Several examples are given in which the distributions of

UCPI}$ (Upper Confidence Power Iteration) algorithm for this problem, a
low-complexity algorithm which estimates the spectral gap in time ${\cal O}(n)$
and memory space ${\cal O}((\ln n)^2)$ given $n$ samples. This is in stark
contrast with most known methods which require at least memory space ${\cal
O}(|\Omega|)$, so that they cannot be applied to large state spaces.
Furthermore, ${\tt UCPI}$ is amenable to parallel implementation.

variants of low precision floating point operations, and in particular, FP16
accumulating into FP32 Micikevicius et al. (2017). On the other hand, while a
lot of research has also happened in the domain of low and mixed-precision
Integer training, these works either present results for non-SOTA networks (for
instance only AlexNet for ImageNet-1K), or relatively small datasets (like
CIFAR-10). In this work, we train state-of-the-art visual understanding neural
networks on the ImageNet-1K dataset, with Integer operations on General Purpose
(GP) hardware. In particular, we focus on Integer Fused-Multiply-and-Accumulate
(FMA) operations which take two pairs of INT16 operands and accumulate results
into an INT32 output.We propose a shared exponent representation of tensors and
develop a Dynamic Fixed Point (DFP) scheme suitable for common neural network
operations. The nuances of developing an efficient integer convolution kernel
is examined, including methods to handle overflow of the INT32 accumulator. We
implement CNN training for ResNet-50, GoogLeNet-v1, VGG-16 and AlexNet; and
these networks achieve or exceed SOTA accuracy within the same number of
iterations as their FP32 counterparts without any change in hyper-parameters
and with a 1.8X improvement in end-to-end training throughput. To the best of
our knowledge these results represent the first INT16 training results on GP
hardware for ImageNet-1K dataset using SOTA CNNs and achieve highest reported

been performed assuming a FLRW universe with no perturbations. In reality this
assumption should be dropped: we show that the inclusion of cosmological
perturbations translates into corrections to the estimate of astrophysical
parameters derived for the merging binary systems. We compute corrections to
the estimate of the luminosity distance due to velocity, volume, lensing and
gravitational potential effects. Our results show that the amplitude of the
corrections will be negligible for current instruments, mildly important for
experiments like the planned DECIGO, and very important for future ones such as

magnetization of single domain La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ nano-islands
arranged in geometrically frustrated configurations such as square ice and
kagome ice geometries. Upon thermal randomization, ensembles of nano-islands
with strong inter-island magnetic coupling relax towards low-energy
configurations. Statistical analysis shows that the likelihood of ensembles
falling into low-energy configurations depends strongly on the annealing
temperature. Annealing to just below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic
film (T$_{C}$ = 338 K) allows for a much greater probability of achieving low
energy configurations as compared to annealing above the Curie temperature. At
this thermally active temperature of 325 K, the ensemble of ferromagnetic
nano-islands explore their energy landscape over time and eventually transition
to lower energy states as compared to the frozen-in configurations obtained
upon cooling from above the Curie temperature. Thus, this materials system
allows for a facile method to systematically study thermal evolution of
artificial spin ice arrays of nano-islands at temperatures modestly above room
temperature.

770,Finding Submodularity Hidden in Symmetric Difference,"  A set function $f$ on a finite set $V$ is submodular if $f(X) + f(Y) \geq f(X
\cup Y) + f(X \cap Y)$ for any pair $X, Y \subseteq V$. The symmetric
difference transformation (SD-transformation) of $f$ by a canonical set $S
\subseteq V$ is a set function $g$ given by $g(X) = f(X \vartriangle S)$ for $X
\subseteq V$,where $X \vartriangle S = (X \setminus S) \cup (S \setminus X)$
denotes the symmetric difference between $X$ and $S$. Submodularity and
SD-transformations are regarded as the counterparts of convexity and affine
transformations in a discrete space, respectively. However, submodularity is
not preserved under SD-transformations, in contrast to the fact that convexity
is invariant under affine transformations. This paper presents a
characterization of SD-stransformations preserving submodularity. Then, we are
concerned with the problem of discovering a canonical set $S$, given the
SD-transformation $g$ of a submodular function $f$ by $S$, provided that $g(X)$
is given by a function value oracle. A submodular function $f$ on $V$ is said
to be strict if $f(X) + f(Y) > f(X \cup Y) + f(X \cap Y)$ holds whenever both
$X \setminus Y$ and $Y \setminus X$ are nonempty. We show that the problem is
solved by using ${\rm O}(|V|)$ oracle calls when $f$ is strictly submodular,
although it requires exponentially many oracle calls in general.

771,A Simple Convolutional Generative Network for Next Item Recommendation,"  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently introduced in the
domain of session-based next item recommendation. An ordered collection of past
items the user has interacted with in a session (or sequence) are embedded into
a 2-dimensional latent matrix, and treated as an image. The convolution and
pooling operations are then applied to the mapped item embeddings. In this
paper, we first examine the typical session-based CNN recommender and show that
both the generative model and network architecture are suboptimal when modeling
long-range dependencies in the item sequence. To address the issues, we
introduce a simple, but very effective generative model that is capable of
learning high-level representation from both short- and long-range item
dependencies. The network architecture of the proposed model is formed of a
stack of \emph{holed} convolutional layers, which can efficiently increase the
receptive fields without relying on the pooling operation. Another contribution
is the effective use of residual block structure in recommender systems, which
can ease the optimization for much deeper networks. The proposed generative
model attains state-of-the-art accuracy with less training time in the next
item recommendation task. It accordingly can be used as a powerful
recommendation baseline to beat in future, especially when there are long
sequences of user feedback.

FeZnMo$_3$O$_8$. Our main finding is a giant high-temperature optical diode
effect, or nonreciprocal directional dichroism, where the transmitted light
intensity in one direction is over 100 times lower than intensity transmitted
in the opposite direction. The effect takes place in the paramagnetic phase
with no long-range magnetic order in the crystal, which contrasts sharply with
all existing reports of the terahertz optical diode effect in other
magnetoelectric materials, where the long-range magnetic ordering is a
necessary prerequisite. In \fzmo, the effect occurs resonantly with a strong
magnetic dipole active transition centered at 1.27 THz and assigned as electron
spin resonance between the eigenstates of the single-ion anisotropy
Hamiltonian. We propose that the optical diode effect in paramagnetic
FeZnMo$_3$O$_8$ is driven by signle-ion terms in magnetoelectric free energy.

773,Phase diagrams of Bose-Hubbard model and antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 models on a honeycomb lattice,"  Motivated by the recent experimental realization of the Haldane model by
ultracold fermions in an optical lattice, we investigate phase diagrams of the
hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice. This model is closely
related with a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic (AF) quantum spin model.
Nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping amplitude is positive and it prefers an AF
configurations of phases of Bose-Einstein condensates. On the other hand, an
amplitude of the next-NN hopping depends on an angle variable as in the Haldane
model. Phase diagrams are obtained by means of an extended path-integral
Monte-Carlo simulations. Besides the AF state, a 120$^o$-order state, there
appear other phases including a Bose metal in which no long-range orders exist.

774,Forecasting the Impact of Stellar Activity on Transiting Exoplanet Spectra,"  Exoplanet host star activity, in the form of unocculted star spots or
faculae, alters the observed transmission and emission spectra of the
exoplanet. This effect can be exacerbated when combining data from different
epochs if the stellar photosphere varies between observations due to activity.
redHere we present a method to characterize and correct for relative changes
due to stellar activity by exploiting multi-epoch ($\ge$2 visits/transits)
observations to place them in a consistent reference frame. Using measurements
from portions of the planet's orbit where negligible planet transmission or
emission can be assumed, we determine changes to the stellar spectral
amplitude. With the analytical methods described here, we predict the impact of
stellar variability on transit observations. Supplementing these forecasts with
Kepler-measured stellar variabilities for F-, G-, K-, and M-dwarfs, and
predicted transit precisions by JWST's NIRISS, NIRCam, and MIRI, we conclude
that stellar activity does not impact infrared transiting exoplanet
observations of most presently-known or predicted TESS targets by current or
near-future platforms, such as JWST.

formula is valid at all orders in perturbation theory, is also valid in all
gauges and includes scalar, vector and tensor modes. A direct consequence of
our results is that the maps of the logarithmic temperature anisotropies are
much cleaner than the usual CMB maps, because they automatically remove many
secondary anisotropies. This can for instance, facilitate the search for
primordial non-Gaussianity in future works. It also disentangles the non-linear
ISW from other effects. Finally, we provide a method which can iteratively be
used to obtain the lensing solution at the desired order.

that takes particular advantage of recent advances in the understanding of both
Convolutional Neural Networks as well as ResNets. Our approach focuses upon the
importance of a trainable pre-processing when using FC-ResNets and we show that
a low-capacity FCN model can serve as a pre-processor to normalize medical
input data. In our image segmentation pipeline, we use FCNs to obtain
normalized images, which are then iteratively refined by means of a FC-ResNet
to generate a segmentation prediction. As in other fully convolutional
approaches, our pipeline can be used off-the-shelf on different image
modalities. We show that using this pipeline, we exhibit state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Electron Microscopy benchmark, when compared to
other 2D methods. We improve segmentation results on CT images of liver
lesions, when contrasting with standard FCN methods. Moreover, when applying
our 2D pipeline on a challenging 3D MRI prostate segmentation challenge we
reach results that are competitive even when compared to 3D methods. The
obtained results illustrate the strong potential and versatility of the
pipeline by achieving highly accurate results on multi-modality images from
different anatomical regions and organs.

778,Strong isomorphism in Marinatto-Weber type quantum games,"  Our purpose is to focus attention on a new criterion for quantum schemes by
bringing together the notions of quantum game and game isomorphism. A quantum
game scheme is required to generate the classical game as a special case. Now,
given a quantum game scheme and two isomorphic classical games, we additionally
require the resulting quantum games to be isomorphic as well. We show how this
isomorphism condition influences the players' strategy sets. We are concerned
with the Marinatto-Weber type quantum game scheme and the strong isomorphism
between games in strategic form.

779,Causal Inference by Stochastic Complexity,"  The algorithmic Markov condition states that the most likely causal direction
between two random variables X and Y can be identified as that direction with
the lowest Kolmogorov complexity. Due to the halting problem, however, this
notion is not computable.
We hence propose to do causal inference by stochastic complexity. That is, we
propose to approximate Kolmogorov complexity via the Minimum Description Length
(MDL) principle, using a score that is mini-max optimal with regard to the
model class under consideration. This means that even in an adversarial
setting, such as when the true distribution is not in this class, we still
obtain the optimal encoding for the data relative to the class.
We instantiate this framework, which we call CISC, for pairs of univariate
discrete variables, using the class of multinomial distributions. Experiments
show that CISC is highly accurate on synthetic, benchmark, as well as
real-world data, outperforming the state of the art by a margin, and scales
extremely well with regard to sample and domain sizes.

780,WOMBAT: A Scalable and High Performance Astrophysical MHD Code,"  We present a new code for astrophysical magneto-hydrodynamics specifically
designed and optimized for high performance and scaling on modern and future
supercomputers. We describe a novel hybrid OpenMP/MPI programming model that
emerged from a collaboration between Cray, Inc. and the University of
Minnesota. This design utilizes MPI-RMA optimized for thread scaling, which
allows the code to run extremely efficiently at very high thread counts ideal
for the latest generation of the multi-core and many-core architectures. Such
performance characteristics are needed in the era of ""exascale"" computing. We
describe and demonstrate our high-performance design in detail with the intent
that it may be used as a model for other, future astrophysical codes intended

781,Securing Virtual Network Function Placement with High Availability Guarantees,"  Virtual Network Functions as a Service (VNFaaS) is currently under attentive
study by telecommunications and cloud stakeholders as a promising business and
technical direction consisting of providing network functions as a service on a
cloud (NFV Infrastructure), instead of delivering standalone network
appliances, in order to provide higher scalability and reduce maintenance
costs. However, the functioning of such NFVI hosting the VNFs is fundamental
for all the services and applications running on top of it, forcing to
guarantee a high availability level. Indeed the availability of an VNFaaS
relies on the failure rate of its single components, namely the servers, the
virtualization software, and the communication network. The proper assignment
of the virtual machines implementing network functions to NFVI servers and
their protection is essential to guarantee high availability. We model the High
Availability Virtual Network Function Placement (HA-VNFP) as the problem of
finding the best assignment of virtual machines to servers guaranteeing
protection by replication. We propose a probabilistic approach to measure the
real availability of a system and design both efficient and effective
algorithms that can be used by stakeholders for both online and offline
planning.

782,The Case for Pyriproxyfen as a Potential Cause for Microcephaly; From Biology to Epidemiology,"  The Zika virus has been found in individual cases but has not been confirmed
as the cause of in the large number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil in
2015-6. Indeed, disparities between the incidence of Zika and microcephaly
across geographic locations has led to questions about the virus's role. Here
we consider whether the insecticide pyriproxyfen used in Brazilian drinking
water might be the primary cause or a cofactor. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile
hormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat
soluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin
A, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development
has been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone
analog approved as an insecticide in the 1970s has been shown to cause
developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another retinoid causing
microcephaly via activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses.
We review tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo, which actually
found some evidence for this effect, including low brain mass and
arhinencephaly in exposed rat pups. Pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is
unprecedented, never having been applied to a water supply on a large scale.
Claims that its geographical pattern of use rule it out as a cause have not
been documented or confirmed. On the other hand, the very few microcephaly
cases reported in Colombia and the wide discrepancies of incidence in different
states across Brazil despite large numbers of Zika cases undermine the claim
that Zika is the cause. Given this combination of potential molecular
mechanism, toxicological and epidemiological evidence we strongly recommend
that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal
link to microcephaly is investigated further.

783,CODA: Enabling Co-location of Computation and Data for Near-Data Processing,"  Recent studies have demonstrated that near-data processing (NDP) is an
effective technique for improving performance and energy efficiency of
data-intensive workloads. However, leveraging NDP in realistic systems with
multiple memory modules introduces a new challenge. In today's systems, where
no computation occurs in memory modules, the physical address space is
interleaved at a fine granularity among all memory modules to help improve the
utilization of processor-memory interfaces by distributing the memory traffic.
However, this is at odds with efficient use of NDP, which requires careful
placement of data in memory modules such that near-data computations and their
exclusively used data can be localized in individual memory modules, while
distributing shared data among memory modules to reduce hotspots. In order to
address this new challenge, we propose a set of techniques that (1) enable
collections of OS pages to either be fine-grain interleaved among memory
modules (as is done today) or to be placed contiguously on individual memory
modules (as is desirable for NDP private data), and (2) decide whether to
localize or distribute each memory object based on its anticipated access
pattern and steer computations to the memory where the data they access is
located. Our evaluations across a wide range of workloads show that the
proposed mechanism improves performance by 31% and reduces 38% remote data
accesses over a baseline system that cannot exploit computate-data affinity
characteristics.

784,Generative Models for Spear Phishing Posts on Social Media,"  Historically, machine learning in computer security has prioritized defense:
think intrusion detection systems, malware classification, and botnet traffic
identification. Offense can benefit from data just as well. Social networks,
with their access to extensive personal data, bot-friendly APIs, colloquial
syntax, and prevalence of shortened links, are the perfect venues for spreading
machine-generated malicious content. We aim to discover what capabilities an
adversary might utilize in such a domain. We present a long short-term memory
(LSTM) neural network that learns to socially engineer specific users into
clicking on deceptive URLs. The model is trained with word vector
representations of social media posts, and in order to make a click-through
more likely, it is dynamically seeded with topics extracted from the target's
timeline. We augment the model with clustering to triage high value targets
based on their level of social engagement, and measure success of the LSTM's
phishing expedition using click-rates of IP-tracked links. We achieve state of
the art success rates, tripling those of historic email attack campaigns, and
outperform humans manually performing the same task.

785,SkipFlow: Incorporating Neural Coherence Features for End-to-End Automatic Text Scoring,"  Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous potential for Automatic Text
Scoring (ATS) tasks. In this paper, we describe a new neural architecture that
enhances vanilla neural network models with auxiliary neural coherence
features. Our new method proposes a new \textsc{SkipFlow} mechanism that models
relationships between snapshots of the hidden representations of a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network as it reads. Subsequently, the semantic
relationships between multiple snapshots are used as auxiliary features for
prediction. This has two main benefits. Firstly, essays are typically long
sequences and therefore the memorization capability of the LSTM network may be
insufficient. Implicit access to multiple snapshots can alleviate this problem
by acting as a protection against vanishing gradients. The parameters of the
\textsc{SkipFlow} mechanism also acts as an auxiliary memory. Secondly,
modeling relationships between multiple positions allows our model to learn
features that represent and approximate textual coherence. In our model, we
call this \textit{neural coherence} features. Overall, we present a unified
deep learning architecture that generates neural coherence features as it reads
in an end-to-end fashion. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on the benchmark ASAP dataset, outperforming not only feature
engineering baselines but also other deep learning models.

is shown that the method produced an agent that matched or surpassed the
performance of a commonly used reference model. To demonstrate the generality
of the method, the exact same algorithm was also tested by training it for an
overtaking case on a road with oncoming traffic. Furthermore, a novel way of
applying a convolutional neural network to high level input that represents
interchangeable objects is also introduced.

787,Reduction of topological $\mathbb{Z}$ classification in cold atomic systems,"  One of the most challenging problems in correlated topological systems is a
realization of the reduction of topological classification, but very few
experimental platforms have been proposed so far. We here demonstrate that
ultracold dipolar fermions (e.g., $^{167}$Er, $^{161}$Dy, and $^{53}$Cr) loaded
in an optical lattice of two-leg ladder geometry can be the first promising
testbed for the reduction $\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}_4$, where solid evidence for
the reduction is available thanks to their high controllability. We further
give a detailed account of how to experimentally access this phenomenon; around
the edges, the destruction of one-particle gapless excitations can be observed
by the local radio frequency spectroscopy, while that of gapless spin
excitations can be observed by a time-dependent spin expectation value of a
superposed state of the ground state and the first excited state. We clarify
that even when the reduction occurs, a gapless edge mode is recovered around a
dislocation, which can be another piece of evidence for the reduction.

788,Reducing biases on $H_0$ measurements using strong lensing and galaxy dynamics: results from the EAGLE simulation,"  Cosmological parameter constraints from observations of time-delay lenses are
becoming increasingly precise. However, there may be significant bias and
scatter in these measurements due to, among other things, the so-called
mass-sheet degeneracy. To estimate these uncertainties, we analyze strong
lenses from the largest EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a mass-sheet
transformation to the radial density profiles of lenses, and by selecting
lenses near isothermality, we find that the bias on H0 can be reduced to 5%
with an intrinsic scatter of 10%, confirming previous results performed on a
different simulation data set. We further investigate whether combining lensing
observables with kinematic constraints helps to minimize this bias. We do not
detect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or
observational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens
configuration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate
estimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased
low (high). With kinematic constraints, double lenses show bias and intrinsic
scatter of 6% and 10%, respectively, while quad lenses show bias and intrinsic
scatter of 0.5% and 10%, respectively. For lenses with a reduced $\chi^2 > 1$,
a power-law dependence of the $\chi^2$ on the lens environment (number of
nearby galaxies) is seen. Lastly, we model, in greater detail, the cases of two
double lenses that are significantly biased. We are able to remove the bias,
suggesting that the remaining biases could also be reduced by carefully taking
into account additional sources of systematic uncertainty.

large-scale ionospheric transient equivalent currents to north-south and
south-north IMF turnings by using a dynamical network of ground-based
magnetometers. Canonical correlation between all pairs of SuperMAG magnetometer
stations in the Northern Hemisphere (magnetic latitude (MLAT) 50-82$^{\circ}$)
is used to establish the extent of near-simultaneous magnetic response between
regions of magnetic local time-MLAT. Parameters and maps that describe
spatial-temporal correlation are used to characterize the system and its
response to the turnings aggregated over several hundred events. We find that
regions that experience large increases in correlation post turning coincide
with typical locations of a two-cell convection system and are influenced by
the interplanetary magnetic field $\mathit{B}_{y}$. The time between the
turnings reaching the magnetopause and a network response is found to be
$\sim$8-10 min and correlation in the dayside occurs 2-8 min before that in the
nightside.

programing, and enjoys reliable local convergence and robust stability
guarantees. Numerical simulations and stabilization of a real-world inverted

multi-soliton solution of the multi-component Maccari system is constructed.
The multi-component Maccari system considered comprised of multiple (say $M$)
short-wave components and one long-wave component with all possible
combinations of nonlinearities including all-focusing, all-defocusing and mixed
types. We firstly derive the two-bright-one-dark (2-b-1-d) and
one-bright-two-dark (1-b-2-d) mixed multi-soliton solutions to the
three-component Maccari system in detail. For the interaction between two
solitons, the asymptotic analysis shows that inelastic collision can take place
in a $M$-component Maccari system with $M \geq 3$ only if the bright parts of
the mixed solitons appear at least in two short-wave components. The
energy-exchanging inelastic collision characterized by an intensity
redistribution among the bright parts of the mixed solitons. While the dark
parts of the mixed solitons and the solitons in the long-wave component always
undergo elastic collision which just accompanied by a position shift. In the
end, we extend the corresponding analysis to the $M$-component Maccari system
to obtain its mixed multi-soliton solution. The formula obtained unifies the
all-bright, all-dark and mixed multi-soliton solutions.

793,Resolution and Relevance Trade-offs in Deep Learning,"  Deep learning has been successfully applied to various tasks, but its
underlying mechanism remains unclear. Neural networks associate similar inputs
in the visible layer to the same state of hidden variables in deep layers. The
fraction of inputs that are associated to the same state is a natural measure
of similarity and is simply related to the cost in bits required to represent
these inputs. The degeneracy of states with the same information cost provides
instead a natural measure of noise and is simply related the entropy of the
frequency of states, that we call relevance. Representations with minimal
noise, at a given level of similarity (resolution), are those that maximise the
relevance. A signature of such efficient representations is that frequency
distributions follow power laws. We show, in extensive numerical experiments,
that deep neural networks extract a hierarchy of efficient representations from
data, because they i) achieve low levels of noise (i.e. high relevance) and ii)
exhibit power law distributions. We also find that the layer that is most
efficient to reliably generate patterns of training data is the one for which
relevance and resolution are traded at the same price, which implies that
frequency distribution follows Zipf's law.

combinatorial optimisation problems in large real-world and synthetic complex

Explorer), provides a unified framework for scalable computation and
presentation of high-quality suboptimal solutions and bounds for a number of

and applicability to large-scale graphs and complex networks are particularly

covering, minimum dominating set, as well as the longest simple cycle problem.
Suboptimal solutions and intervals for optimal objective values are estimated
using scalable heuristics. The tool is designed with extensibility in mind,
with the view of further problems and both new fast and high-performance
heuristics to be added in the future. GraphCombEx has already been successfully
used as a support tool in a number of recent research studies using
combinatorial optimisation to analyse complex networks, indicating its promise

(NLP) applications such as Information Retrieval, Machine Translation or
Lexical Simplification. WSD is the ability of determining a word sense among

The most straightforward approach uses a semantic proximity measure between the
word sense candidates of the target word and those of its context. Such a
method very easily entails a combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we propose
two methods based on distributional analysis which enable to reduce the
exponential complexity without losing the coherence. We present a comparison
between the selection of distributional neighbors and the linearly nearest
neighbors. The figures obtained show that selecting distributional neighbors

797,Non-degenerate parametric resonance in tunable superconducting cavity,"  We develop a theory for non-degenerate parametric resonance in a tunable
superconducting cavity. We focus on nonlinear effects that are caused by
nonlinear Josephson elements connected to the cavity. We analyze parametric
amplification in a strong nonlinear regime at the parametric instability
threshold, and calculate maximum gain values. Above the threshold, in the
parametric oscillator regime the linear cavity response diverges at the
oscillator frequency at all pump strengths. We show that this divergence is
related to the continuous degeneracy of the free oscillator state with respect
to the phase. Applying on-resonance input lifts the degeneracy and removes the
divergence. We also investigate the quantum noise squeezing. It is shown that
in the strong amplification regime the noise undergoes four-mode squeezing, and
that in this regime the output signal to noise ratio can significantly exceed
the input value. We also analyze the intermode frequency conversion and
identify parameters at which full conversion is achieved.

798,Human peripheral blur is optimal for object recognition,"  Our eyes sample a disproportionately large amount of information at the
centre of gaze with increasingly sparse sampling into the periphery. This
sampling scheme is widely believed to be a wiring constraint whereby high
resolution at the centre is achieved by sacrificing spatial acuity in the
periphery. Here we propose that this sampling scheme may be optimal for object
recognition because the relevant spatial content is dense near an object and
sparse in the surrounding vicinity. We tested this hypothesis by training deep
convolutional neural networks on full-resolution and foveated images. Our main
finding is that networks trained on images with foveated sampling show better
object classification compared to networks trained on full resolution images.
Importantly, blurring images according to the human blur function yielded the
best performance compared to images with shallower or steeper blurring. Taken
together our results suggest that, peripheral blurring in our eyes may have
evolved for optimal object recognition, rather than merely to satisfy wiring
constraints.

800,Bridging Semantic Gaps between Natural Languages and APIs with Word Embedding,"  Developers increasingly rely on text matching tools to analyze the relation
between natural language words and APIs. However, semantic gaps, namely textual
mismatches between words and APIs, negatively affect these tools. Previous
studies have transformed words or APIs into low-dimensional vectors for
matching; however, inaccurate results were obtained due to the failure of
modeling words and APIs simultaneously. To resolve this problem, two main
challenges are to be addressed: the acquisition of massive words and APIs for
mining and the alignment of words and APIs for modeling. Therefore, this study
proposes Word2API to effectively estimate relatedness of words and APIs.
Word2API collects millions of commonly used words and APIs from code
repositories to address the acquisition challenge. Then, a shuffling strategy
is used to transform related words and APIs into tuples to address the
alignment challenge. Using these tuples, Word2API models words and APIs
simultaneously. Word2API outperforms baselines by 10%-49.6% of relatedness
estimation in terms of precision and NDCG. Word2API is also effective on
solving typical software tasks, e.g., query expansion and API documents
linking. A simple system with Word2API-expanded queries recommends up to 21.4%
more related APIs for developers. Meanwhile, Word2API improves comparison
algorithms by 7.9%-17.4% in linking questions in Question&Answer communities to

(ATF),which consists of U$_3$Si$_2$ fuel and FeCrAl cladding. In comparison
with current UO$_2$-Zr system, FeCrAl has a better oxidation resistance but a
larger thermal neutron absorption cross section. U$_3$Si$_2$ has a higher
thermal conductivity and a higher uranium density, which can compensate the
reactivity suppressed by FeCrAl. Based on neutronic investigations, a possible
U$_3$Si$_2$-FeCrAl fuel-cladding systemis taken into consideration. Fundamental
properties of the suggested fuel-cladding combination are investigated in a
fuel assembly.These properties include moderator and fuel temperature
coefficients, control rods worth, radial power distribution (in a fuel rod),
and different void reactivity coefficients. The present work proves that the
new combination has less reactivity variation during its service lifetime.
Although, compared with the current system, it has a little larger deviation on
power distribution and a little less negative temperature coefficient and void
reactivity coefficient and its control rods worth is less important, variations
of these parameters are less important during the service lifetime of fuel.
Hence, U$_3$Si$_2$-FeCrAl system is a potential ATF candidate from a neutronic

properties of Fe/MgAl${}_2$O${}_4$/Fe(001) magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs)
by comparing them with those of Fe/MgO/Fe(001) MTJs. By means of the
nonequilibrium Green's function method and the density functional theory, we
calculate bias voltage dependences of magnetoresistance (MR) ratios in both the
MTJs. We find that in both the MTJs, the MR ratio decreases as the bias voltage
increases and finally vanishes at a critical bias voltage $V_{\rm c}$. We also
find that the critical bias voltage $V_{\rm c}$ of the MgAl${}_2$O${}_4$-based
MTJ is clearly larger than that of the MgO-based MTJ. Since the in-plane
lattice constant of the Fe/MgAl${}_2$O${}_4$/Fe(001) supercell is twice that of
the Fe/MgO/Fe(001) one, the Fe electrodes in the MgAl${}_2$O${}_4$-based MTJs
have an identical band structure to that obtained by folding the Fe band
structure of the MgO-based MTJs in the Brillouin zone of the in-plane wave
vector. We show that such a difference in the Fe band structure is the origin
of the difference in the critical bias voltage $V_{\rm c}$ between the
MgAl${}_2$O${}_4$- and MgO-based MTJs.

However, it is still challenging to recognize AUs from spontaneous facial
displays especially when they are accompanied with speech. Different from all
prior work that utilized visual observations for facial AU recognition, this
paper presents a novel approach that recognizes speech-related AUs exclusively
from audio signals based on the fact that facial activities are highly
correlated with voice during speech. Specifically, dynamic and physiological
relationships between AUs and phonemes are modeled through a continuous time
Bayesian network (CTBN); then AU recognition is performed by probabilistic
inference via the CTBN model.
A pilot audiovisual AU-coded database has been constructed to evaluate the
proposed audio-based AU recognition framework. The database consists of a
""clean"" subset with frontal and neutral faces and a challenging subset
collected with large head movements and occlusions. Experimental results on
this database show that the proposed CTBN model achieves promising recognition

810,Estimating Achievable Range of Ground Robots Operating on Single Battery Discharge for Operational Efficacy Amelioration,"  Mobile robots are increasingly being used to assist with active pursuit and
law enforcement. One major limitation for such missions is the resource
(battery) allocated to the robot. Factors like nature and agility of evader,
terrain over which pursuit is being carried out, plausible traversal velocity
and the amount of necessary data to be collected all influence how long the
robot can last in the field and how far it can travel. In this paper, we
develop an analytical model that analyzes the energy utilization for a variety
of components mounted on a robot to estimate the maximum operational range
achievable by the robot operating on a single battery discharge. We categorize
the major consumers of energy as: 1.) ancillary robotic functions such as
computation, communication, sensing etc., and 2.) maneuvering which involves
propulsion, steering etc. Both these consumers draw power from the common power
source but the achievable range is largely affected by the proportion of power
available for maneuvering. For this case study, we performed experiments with
real robots on planar and graded surfaces and evaluated the estimation error
for each case.

811,Likelihood ratio test for variance components in nonlinear mixed effects models,"  Mixed effects models are widely used to describe heterogeneity in a
population. A crucial issue when adjusting such a model to data consists in
identifying fixed and random effects. From a statistical point of view, it
remains to test the nullity of the variances of a given subset of random
effects. Some authors have proposed to use the likelihood ratio test and have
established its asymptotic distribution in some particular cases. Nevertheless,
to the best of our knowledge, no general variance components testing procedure
has been fully investigated yet. In this paper, we study the likelihood ratio
test properties to test that the variances of a general subset of the random
effects are equal to zero in both linear and nonlinear mixed effects model,
extending the existing results. We prove that the asymptotic distribution of
the test is a chi-bar-square distribution, that is to say a mixture of
chi-square distributions, and we identify the corresponding weights. We
highlight in particular that the limiting distribution depends on the presence
of correlations between the random effects but not on the linear or nonlinear
structure of the mixed effects model. We illustrate the finite sample size
properties of the test procedure through simulation studies and apply the test
procedure to two real datasets of dental growth and of coucal growth.

telescopes to form a tied-array telescope that provides high signal-to-noise
observations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with the objective to increase the
sensitivity of detecting low-frequency gravitational waves. As part of this
endeavor we have developed a software correlator and beamformer which enables
the formation of a tied-array beam from the raw voltages from each of
telescopes. We explain the concepts and techniques involved in the process of
adding the raw voltages coherently. We further present the software processing
pipeline that is specifically designed to deal with data from widely spaced,
inhomogeneous radio telescopes and describe the steps involved in preparing,
correlating and creating the tied-array beam. This includes polarization
calibration, bandpass correction, frequency dependent phase correction,
interference mitigation and pulsar gating. A link is provided where the
software can be obtained.

814,Comparative Climates of TRAPPIST-1 planetary system: results from a simple climate-vegetation model,"  The recent discovery of the planetary system hosted by the ultracool dwarf
star TRAPPIST-1 could open new perspectives into the investigation of planetary
climates of Earth-sized exoplanets, their atmospheres and their possible
habitability. In this paper, we use a simple climate-vegetation energy-balance
model to study the climate of the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets and the climate
dependence on the global albedo, on the fraction of vegetation that could cover
their surfaces and on the different greenhouse conditions. The model allows us
to investigate whether liquid water could be maintained on the planetary
surfaces (i.e., by defining a ""surface water zone"") in different planetary
conditions, with or without the presence of greenhouse effect.
It is shown that planet TRAPPIST-1d seems to be the most stable from an
Earth-like perspective, since it resides in the surface water zone for a wide
range of reasonable values of the model parameters. Moreover, according to the
model outer planets (f, g and h) cannot host liquid water on their surfaces,
even for Earth-like conditions, entering a snowball state. Although very
simple, the model allows to extract the main features of the TRAPPIST-1
planetary climates.

817,Complementary views on electron spectra: From Fluctuation Diagnostics to real space correlations,"  We study the relation between the microscopic properties of a many-body
system and the electron spectra, experimentally accessible by photoemission. In
a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 236402 (2015)], we introduced the
""fluctuation diagnostics"" approach, to extract the dominant wave vector
dependent bosonic fluctuations from the electronic self-energy. Here, we first
reformulate the theory in terms of fermionic modes, to render its connection
with resonance valence bond (RVB) fluctuations more transparent. Secondly, by
using a large-U expansion, where U is the Coulomb interaction, we relate the
fluctuations to real space correlations. Therefore, it becomes possible to
study how electron spectra are related to charge, spin, superconductivity and
RVB-like real space correlations, broadening the analysis of an earlier work
[Phys. Rev. B 89, 245130 (2014)]. This formalism is applied to the pseudogap
physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, studied in the dynamical cluster
approximation. We perform calculations for embedded clusters with up to 32
sites, having three inequivalent K-points at the Fermi surface. We find that as
U is increased, correlation functions gradually attain values consistent with
an RVB state. This first happens for correlation functions involving the
antinodal point and gradually spreads to the nodal point along the Fermi
surface. Simultaneously a pseudogap opens up along the Fermi surface. We relate
this to a crossover from a Kondo-like state to an RVB-like localized cluster
state and to the presence of RVB and spin fluctuations. These changes are
caused by a strong momentum dependence in the cluster bath-couplings along the
Fermi surface. We also show, from a more algorithmic perspective, how the
time-consuming calculations in fluctuation diagnostics can be drastically
simplified.

818,Stall force of a cargo driven by N interacting motor proteins,"  We study a generic one-dimensional model for an intracellular cargo driven by
N motor proteins against an external applied force. The model includes
motor-cargo and motor-motor interactions. The cargo motion is described by an
over-damped Langevin equation, while motor dynamics is specified by hopping
rates which follow a local detailed balance condition with respect to change in
energy per hopping event. Based on this model, we show that the stall force,
the mean external force corresponding to zero mean cargo velocity, is
completely independent of the details of the interactions and is, therefore,
always equal to the sum of the stall forces of the individual motors. This
exact result is arrived on the basis of a simple assumption: the (macroscopic)
state of stall of the cargo is analogous to a state of thermodynamic
equilibrium, and is characterized by vanishing net probability current between
any two microstates, with the latter specified by motor positions relative to
the cargo. The corresponding probability distribution of the microstates under
stall is also determined. These predictions are in complete agreement with
numerical simulations, carried out using specific forms of interaction
potentials.

819,Dynamics of a Camphoric Acid boat at the air-water interface,"  We report experiments on an agarose gel tablet loaded with camphoric acid
(c-boat) set into self-motion by interfacial tension gradients at the air-water
interface. We observe three distinct modes of c-boat motion: harmonic mode
where the c-boat speed oscillates sinusoidally in time, a steady mode where the
c-boat maintains constant speed, and a relaxation oscillation mode where the
c-boat maintains near-zero speed between sudden jumps in speed and position at
regular time intervals. Whereas all three modes have been separately reported
before in different systems, we show they belong to a common description.
Through control of the air-water surface tension with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate
(SDS), we experimentally deduce the three self-propulsive modes result from
surface tension difference between Camphoric Acid (CA) and the ambient
surroundings.

820,Efficient Graph Edit Distance Computation and Verification via Anchor-aware Lower Bound Estimation,"  Graph edit distance (GED) is an important similarity measure adopted in a
similarity-based analysis between two graphs, and computing GED is a primitive
operator in graph database analysis. Partially due to the NP-hardness, the
existing techniques for computing GED are only able to process very small
graphs with less than 30 vertices. Motivated by this, in this paper we
systematically study the problems of both GED computation, and GED verification
(i.e., verify whether the GED between two graphs is no larger than a user-given
threshold). Firstly, we develop a unified framework that can be instantiated
into either a best-first search approach AStar+ or a depth-first search
approach DFS+. Secondly, we design anchor-aware lower bound estimation
techniques to compute tighter lower bounds for intermediate search states,
which significantly reduce the search spaces of both AStar+ and DFS+. We also
propose efficient techniques to compute the lower bounds. Thirdly, based on our
unified framework, we contrast AStar+ with DFS+ regarding their time and space
complexities, and recommend that AStar+ is better than DFS+ by having a much
smaller search space. Extensive empirical studies validate that AStar+ performs
better than DFS+, and show that our AStar+-BMa approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art technique by more than four orders of magnitude.

the security and efficiency of these ""mental algorithms"" has been analyzed only

study of humanly computable password strategies, involving a learning phase (to
learn a password strategy), then a rehearsal phase (to login to a few

participants were able to calculate a deterministic eight-character password
for an arbitrary new website in under 20 seconds.

823,Structural changes in the interbank market across the financial crisis from multiple core-periphery analysis,"  Interbank markets are often characterised in terms of a core-periphery
network structure, with a highly interconnected core of banks holding the
market together, and a periphery of banks connected mostly to the core but not
internally. This paradigm has recently been challenged for short time scales,
where interbank markets seem better characterised by a bipartite structure with
more core-periphery connections than inside the core. Using a novel
core-periphery detection method on the eMID interbank market, we enrich this
picture by showing that the network is actually characterised by multiple
core-periphery pairs. Moreover, a transition from core-periphery to bipartite
structures occurs by shortening the temporal scale of data aggregation. We
further show how the global financial crisis transformed the market, in terms
of composition, multiplicity and internal organisation of core-periphery pairs.
By unveiling such a fine-grained organisation and transformation of the
interbank market, our method can find important applications in the
understanding of how distress can propagate over financial networks.

825,Performance analysis of smart digital signage system based on software-defined IoT and invisible image sensor communication,"  Everything in the world is being connected, and things are becoming
interactive. The future of the interactive world depends on the future Internet
of Things (IoT). Software-defined networking (SDN) technology, a new paradigm
in the networking area, can be useful in creating an IoT because it can handle
interactivity by controlling physical devices, transmission of data among them,
and data acquisition. However, digital signage can be one of the promising
technologies in this era of technology that is progressing toward the
interactive world, connecting users to the IoT network through device-to-device
communication technology. This article illustrates a novel prototype that is
mainly focused on a smart digital signage system comprised of software-defined
IoT (SD-IoT) and invisible image sensor communication technology. We have
proposed an SDN scheme with a view to initiating its flexibility and
compatibility for an IoT network-based smart digital signage system. The idea
of invisible communication can make the users of the technology trendier to it,
and the usage of unused resources such as images and videos can be ensured. In
addition, this communication has paved the way for interactivity between the
user and digital signage, where the digital signage and the camera of a
smartphone can be operated as a transmitter and a receiver, respectively. The
proposed scheme might be applicable to real-world applications because SDN has
the flexibility to adapt with the alteration of network status without any
hardware modifications while displays and smartphones are available everywhere.
A performance analysis of this system showed the advantages of an SD-IoT
network over an Internet protocol-based IoT network considering a queuing
analysis for a dynamic link allocation process in the case of user access to
the IoT network.

826,What pebbles are made of: Interpretation of the V883 Ori disk,"  Recently, an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation
of the water snow line in the protoplanetary disk around the FU Orionis star
V883 Ori was reported. The radial variation of the spectral index at
mm-wavelengths around the snow line was interpreted as being due to a pileup of
particles interior to the snow line. However, radial transport of solids in the
outer disk operates on timescales much longer than the typical timescale of an
FU Ori outburst ($10^{1}$--$10^{2}$ yr). Consequently, a steady-state pileup is
unlikely. We argue that it is only necessary to consider water evaporation and
re-coagulation of silicates to explain the recent ALMA observation of V883 Ori
because these processes are short enough to have had their impact since the
outburst. Our model requires the inner disk to have already been optically
thick before the outburst, and our results suggest that the carbon content of
pebbles is low.

827,Existence and uniqueness of steady weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$,"  The existence of weak solutions to the stationary Navier-Stokes equations in
the whole plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ is proven. This particular geometry was the only
case left open since the work of Leray in 1933. The reason is that due to the
absence of boundaries the local behavior of the solutions cannot be controlled
by the enstrophy in two dimensions. We overcome this difficulty by constructing
approximate weak solutions having a prescribed mean velocity on some given
bounded set. As a corollary, we obtain infinitely many weak solutions in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ parameterized by this mean velocity, which is reminiscent of the
expected convergence of the velocity field at large distances to any prescribed
constant vector field. This explicit parameterization of the weak solutions
allows us to prove a weak-strong uniqueness theorem for small data. The
question of the asymptotic behavior of the weak solutions remains however open,
when the uniqueness theorem doesn't apply.

829,Social versus Moral preferences in the Ultimatum Game: A theoretical model and an experiment,"  In the Ultimatum Game (UG) one player, named ""proposer"", has to decide how to
allocate a certain amount of money between herself and a ""responder"". If the
offer is greater than or equal to the responder's minimum acceptable offer
(MAO), then the money is split as proposed, otherwise, neither the proposer nor
the responder get anything. The UG has intrigued generations of behavioral
scientists because people in experiments blatantly violate the equilibrium
predictions that self-interested proposers offer the minimum available non-zero
amount, and self-interested responders accept. Why are these predictions
violated? Previous research has mainly focused on the role of social
preferences. Little is known about the role of general moral preferences for
doing the right thing, preferences that have been shown to play a major role in
other social interactions (e.g., Dictator Game and Prisoner's Dilemma). Here I
develop a theoretical model and an experiment designed to pit social
preferences against moral preferences. I find that, although people recognize
that offering half and rejecting low offers are the morally right things to do,
moral preferences have no causal impact on UG behavior. The experimental data
are indeed well fit by a model according to which: (i) high UG offers are
motivated by inequity aversion and, to a lesser extent, self-interest; (ii)
high MAOs are motivated by inequity aversion.

classical-quantum channels and the blocklength $n$ when the transmission rates
approach the channel capacity at a rate slower than $1/\sqrt{n}$, a research
topic known as moderate deviation analysis. We show that the optimal error
probability vanishes under this rate convergence. Our main technical
contributions are a tight quantum sphere-packing bound, obtained via Chaganty
and Sethuraman's concentration inequality in strong large deviation theory, and
asymptotic expansions of error-exponent functions. Moderate deviation analysis
for quantum hypothesis testing is also established. The converse directly
follows from our channel coding result, while the achievability relies on a

832,Panel collapse and its applications,"  We describe a procedure called panel collapse for replacing a CAT(0) cube
complex $\Psi$ by a ""lower complexity"" CAT(0) cube complex $\Psi_\bullet$
whenever $\Psi$ contains a codimension-$2$ hyperplane that is extremal in one
of the codimension-$1$ hyperplanes containing it. Although $\Psi_\bullet$ is
not in general a subcomplex of $\Psi$, it is a subspace consisting of a
subcomplex together with some cubes that sit inside $\Psi$ ""diagonally"". The
hyperplanes of $\Psi_\bullet$ extend to hyperplanes of $\Psi$. Applying this
procedure, we prove: if a group $G$ acts cocompactly on a CAT(0) cube complex
$\Psi$, then there is a CAT(0) cube complex $\Omega$ so that $G$ acts
cocompactly on $\Omega$ and for each hyperplane $H$ of $\Omega$, the stabiliser
in $G$ of $H$ acts on $H$ essentially.
Using panel collapse, we obtain a new proof of Stallings's theorem on groups
with more than one end. As another illustrative example, we show that panel
collapse applies to the exotic cubulations of free groups constructed by Wise.
Next, we show that the CAT(0) cube complexes constructed by Cashen-Macura can
be collapsed to trees while preserving all of the necessary group actions. (It
also illustrates that our result applies to actions of some non-discrete
groups.) We also discuss possible applications to quasi-isometric rigidity for
certain classes of graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups. Panel
collapse is also used in forthcoming work of the first-named author and Wilton
to study fixed-point sets of finite subgroups of $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ on the

high throughput traffic stream in the SDN match-and-action model are presented.
This is in contrast to previous work that either deviated from the match and
action model by requiring additional switch level capabilities or did not
exploit the SDN data plane. Our construction has two parts; (a) how to sample
in an SDN match and action model, (b) how to detect large flows efficiently and
in a scalable way, in the SDN model.
Our large flow detection methods provide high accuracy and present a good and
practical tradeoff between switch - controller traffic, and the number of
entries required in the switch flow table. Based on different parameters, we
differentiate between heavy flows, elephant flows and bulky flows and present
efficient algorithms to detect flows of the different types.
Additionally, as part of our heavy flow detection scheme, we present sampling
methods to sample packets with arbitrary probability $p$ per packet or per byte
that traverses an SDN switch.
Finally, we show how our algorithms can be adapted to a distributed
monitoring SDN setting with multiple switches, and easily scale with the number
of monitoring switches.

analysis flood protection through dike building in the Netherlands, due to
Verweij and Zwaneveld.
Experimental analysis with data for the Ijsselmeer lead to integral optimal
solution of the linear programming relaxation of the IP model.
This naturally led to the question of integrality of the polytope associated
with the IP model.
In this paper we first give a negative answer to this question by
establishing non-integrality of the polytope.
Second, we establish natural conditions that guarantee the linear programming
relaxation of the IP model to be integral.
We then test the most recent data on flood probabilities, damage and
investment costs of the IJsselmeer for these conditions.
Third, we show that the IP model can be solved in polynomial time when the
number of dike segments, or the number of feasible barrier heights, are
constant.

835,Achieving Spectrum Efficient Communication Under Cross-Technology Interference,"  In wireless communication, heterogeneous technologies such as WiFi, ZigBee
and BlueTooth operate in the same ISM band.With the exponential growth in the
number of wireless devices, the ISM band becomes more and more crowded. These
heterogeneous devices have to compete with each other to access spectrum
resources, generating cross-technology interference (CTI). Since CTI may
destroy wireless communication, this field is facing an urgent and challenging
need to investigate spectrum efficiency under CTI. In this paper, we introduce
a novel framework to address this problem from two aspects. On the one hand,
from the perspective of each communication technology itself, we propose novel
channel/link models to capture the channel/link status under CTI. On the other
hand, we investigate spectrum efficiency from the perspective by taking all
heterogeneous technologies as a whole and building crosstechnology
communication among them. The capability of direct communication among
heterogeneous devices brings great opportunities to harmoniously sharing the
spectrum with collaboration rather than competition.

electrons observed by Voyager 1 as it passes through the heliosheath from 95 to
122 AU. The overall intensity change of the background corrected data from the
inner to the outer boundary of the heliosheath is a maximum of a factor ~100 at
15 MeV. At lower energies this fractional change becomes less and the corrected
electron spectra in the heliosheath becomes progressively steeper, reaching
values ~ -2.5 for the spectral index just outside of the termination shock. At
higher energies the spectra of electrons has an exponent changing from the
negative LIS spectral index of -1.3 to values approaching zero in the
heliosheath as a result of the solar modulation of the galactic electron
component. The large modulation effects observed below ~100 MV are possible
evidence for enhanced diffusion as part of the modulation process for electrons
in the heliosheath.

837,Integrating Human-Provided Information Into Belief State Representation Using Dynamic Factorization,"  In partially observed environments, it can be useful for a human to provide
the robot with declarative information that represents probabilistic relational
constraints on properties of objects in the world, augmenting the robot's
sensory observations. For instance, a robot tasked with a search-and-rescue
mission may be informed by the human that two victims are probably in the same
room. An important question arises: how should we represent the robot's
internal knowledge so that this information is correctly processed and combined
with raw sensory information? In this paper, we provide an efficient belief
state representation that dynamically selects an appropriate factoring,
combining aspects of the belief when they are correlated through information
and separating them when they are not. This strategy works in open domains, in
which the set of possible objects is not known in advance, and provides
significant improvements in inference time over a static factoring, leading to
more efficient planning for complex partially observed tasks. We validate our
approach experimentally in two open-domain planning problems: a 2D discrete
gridworld task and a 3D continuous cooking task. A supplementary video can be

838,Characterizing complex networks using Entropy-degree diagrams: unveiling changes in functional brain connectivity induced by Ayahuasca,"  Open problems abound in the theory of complex networks, which has found
successful application to diverse fields of science. With the aim of further
advancing the understanding of the brain's functional connectivity, we propose
to evaluate a network metric which we term the geodesic entropy. This entropy,
in a way that can be made precise, quantifies the Shannon entropy of the
distance distribution to a specific node from all other nodes. Measurements of
geodesic entropy allow for the characterization of the structural information
of a network that takes into account the distinct role of each node into the
network topology. The measurement and characterization of this structural
information has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of sustained
activity and other emergent behaviors in networks, such as self-organized
criticality sometimes seen in such contexts. We apply these concepts and
methods to study the effects of how the psychedelic Ayahuasca affects the
functional connectivity of the human brain. We show that the geodesic entropy
is able to differentiate the functional networks of the human brain in two
different states of consciousness in the resting state: (i) the ordinary waking
state and (ii) a state altered by ingestion of the Ayahuasca. The entropy of
the nodes of brain networks from subjects under the influence of Ayahuasca
diverge significantly from those of the ordinary waking state. The functional
brain networks from subjects in the altered state have, on average, a larger
geodesic entropy compared to the ordinary state. We conclude that geodesic
entropy is a useful tool for analyzing complex networks and discuss how and why
it may bring even further valuable insights into the study of the human brain
and other empirical networks.

Lower House, social media, especially Twitter, was actively used. In this
paper, we analyze the users who retweeted tweets of political parties on
Twitter during the election. Our aim is to clarify what kinds of users are
diffusing (retweeting) tweets of political parties. The results indicate that
the characteristics of retweeters of the largest ruling party (Liberal
Democratic Party of Japan) and the largest opposition party (The Constitutional
Democratic Party of Japan) were similar, even though the retweeters did not
overlap each other. We also found that a particular opposition party (Japanese
Communist Party) had quite different characteristics from other political
parties.

842,When a triangle is isosceles?,"  In 1840 Jacob Steiner on Christian Rudolf's request proved that a triangle
with two equal bisectors is isosceles. But what about changing the bisectors to
cevians? Cevian is any line segment in a triangle with one endpoint on a vertex
of the triangle and other endpoint on the opposite side. Not for any pairs of
equal cevians the triangle is isosceles. Theorem. If for a triangle ABC there
are equal cevians issuing from A and B, which intersect on the bisector or on
the median of the angle C, then AC=BC (so the triangle ABC is isosceles).
Proposition. Let ABC be an isosceles triangle. Define circle C to be the circle
symmetric relative to AB to the circumscribed circle of the triangle ABC. Then
the locus of intersection points of pairs of equal cevians is the union of the
base AB, the triangle's axis of symmetry, and the circle C.

844,The effect of phase change on stability of convective flow in a layer of volatile liquid driven by a horizontal temperature gradient,"  Buoyancy-thermocapillary convection in a layer of volatile liquid driven by a
horizontal temperature gradient arises in a variety of situations. Recent
studies have shown that the composition of the gas phase, which is typically a
mixture of vapour and air, has a noticeable effect on the critical Marangoni
number describing the onset of convection as well as on the observed convection
pattern. Specifically, as the total pressure or, equivalently, the average
concentration of air is decreased, the threshold of the instability leading to
the emergence of convective rolls is found to increase rather significantly. We
present a linear stability analysis of the problem which shows that this trend
can be readily understood by considering the transport of heat and vapour
through the gas phase. In particular, we show that transport in the gas phase
has a noticeable effect even at atmospheric conditions, when phase change is
greatly suppressed.

and complex devices will be accelerated by accessible microscopy techniques
capable of probing magnetic phenomena on picosecond time scales and at deeply
sub-micron length scales. A recently developed time-resolved magneto-thermal
microscope provides a path towards this goal if it is augmented with a
picosecond, nanoscale heat source. We theoretically study adiabatic
nanofocusing and near-field heat induction using conical gold plasmonic
antennas to generate sub-100 nm thermal gradients for time-resolved
magneto-thermal imaging. Finite element calculations of antenna-sample
interactions reveal focused electromagnetic loss profiles that are either
peaked directly under the antenna or are annular, depending on the sample's
conductivity, the antenna's apex radius, and the tip-sample separation. We find
that the thermal gradient is confined to 40 nm to 60 nm full width at half
maximum for realistic ranges of sample conductivity and apex radius. To
mitigate this variation, which is undesirable for microscopy, we investigate
the use of a platinum capping layer on top of the sample as a thermal
transduction layer to produce heat uniformly across different sample materials.
After determining the optimal capping layer thickness, we simulate the
evolution of the thermal gradient in the underlying sample layer, and find that
the temporal width is below 10 ps. These results lay a theoretical foundation
for nanoscale, time-resolved magneto-thermal imaging.

framework are strongly affected by sample size, and are known to be
irreproducible in underpowered studies, yet no suitable replacement has been
proposed. Results: Here we present implementations of non-parametric
standardized median effect size estimates, dNEF, for high-throughput sequencing
datasets. Case studies are shown for transcriptome and tag-sequencing datasets.
The dNEF measure is shown to be more repro- ducible and robust than P values

850,High temperature thermodynamics of the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev-Heisenberg model: A high temperature series expansion study,"  We develop high temperature series expansions for the thermodynamic
properties of the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev-Heisenberg model. Numerical results
for uniform susceptibility, heat capacity and entropy as a function of
temperature for different values of the Kitaev coupling $K$ and Heisenberg
exachange coupling $J$ (with $|J|\le |K|$) are presented. These expansions show
good convergence down to a temperature of a fraction of $K$ and in some cases
down to $T=K/10$. In the Kitaev exchange dominated regime, the inverse
susceptibility has a nearly linear temperature dependence over a wide
temperature range. However, we show that already at temperatures $10$-times the
Curie-Weiss temperature, the effective Curie-Weiss constant estimated from the
data can be off by a factor of 2. We find that the magnitude of the heat
capacity maximum at the short-range order peak, is substantially smaller for
small $J/K$ than for $J$ of order or larger than $K$. We suggest that this
itself represents a simple marker for the relative importance of the Kitaev
terms in these systems. Somewhat surprisingly, both heat capacity and
susceptibility data on Na$_2$IrO$_3$ are consistent with a dominant {\it
antiferromagnetic} Kitaev exchange constant of about $300-400$ $K$.

\R^n$ arising from Pluripotential Theory. We consider the few instances, namely
$E$ being the ball, the simplex, or the sphere, where $\delta_E$ is known to be
Riemaniann and we prove that the eigenfunctions of the associated Laplace
Beltrami operator (with no boundary conditions) are the orthogonal polynomials
with respect to the pluripotential equilibrium measure $\mu_E$ of $E.$ We
conjecture that this may hold in a wider generality.
The considered differential operators have been already introduced in the
framework of orthogonal polynomials and studied in connection with certain
symmetry groups. In this work instead we highlight the relationships between
orthogonal polynomials with respect to $\mu_E$ and the Riemaniann structure

semiconductor microcavity. Such system may exhibit magnetic self-trapping in
the case of sufficiently strong coupling between polaritons and magnetic ions
embedded in the semiconductor. We investigate the effect of the nonequilibrium
nature of exciton-polaritons on the physics of the resulting self-trapped
magnetic polarons. We find that multiple polarons can exist at the same time,
and derive a critical condition for self-trapping which is different to the one
predicted previously in the equilibrium case. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
approximation, we calculate the excitation spectrum and provide a physical
explanation in terms of the effective magnetic attraction between polaritons,
mediated by the ion subsystem.

853,Inference in Sparse Graphs with Pairwise Measurements and Side Information,"  We consider the statistical problem of recovering a hidden ""ground truth""
binary labeling for the vertices of a graph up to low Hamming error from noisy
edge and vertex measurements. We present new algorithms and a sharp
finite-sample analysis for this problem on trees and sparse graphs with poor
expansion properties such as hypergrids and ring lattices. Our method
generalizes and improves over that of Globerson et al. (2015), who introduced
the problem for two-dimensional grid lattices.
For trees we provide a simple, efficient, algorithm that infers the ground
truth with optimal Hamming error has optimal sample complexity and implies
recovery results for all connected graphs. Here, the presence of side
information is critical to obtain a non-trivial recovery rate. We then show how
to adapt this algorithm to tree decompositions of edge-subgraphs of certain
graph families such as lattices, resulting in optimal recovery error rates that
can be obtained efficiently
The thrust of our analysis is to 1) use the tree decomposition along with
edge measurements to produce a small class of viable vertex labelings and 2)
apply an analysis influenced by statistical learning theory to show that we can
infer the ground truth from this class using vertex measurements. We show the
power of our method in several examples including hypergrids, ring lattices,
and the Newman-Watts model for small world graphs. For two-dimensional grids,
our results improve over Globerson et al. (2015) by obtaining optimal recovery
in the constant-height regime.

855,Coherence of Biochemical Oscillations is Bounded by Driving Force and Network Topology,"  Biochemical oscillations are prevalent in living organisms. Systems with a
small number of constituents cannot sustain coherent oscillations for an
indefinite time because of fluctuations in the period of oscillation. We show
that the number of coherent oscillations that quantifies the precision of the
oscillator is universally bounded by the thermodynamic force that drives the
system out of equilibrium and by the topology of the underlying biochemical
network of states. Our results are valid for arbitrary Markov processes, which
are commonly used to model biochemical reactions. We apply our results to a
model for a single KaiC protein and to an activator-inhibitor model that
consists of several molecules. From a mathematical perspective, based on strong
numerical evidence, we conjecture a universal constraint relating the imaginary
and real parts of the first non-trivial eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix.

their outcomes as opposed to ""gaming"" the classifier. We show that whenever any

distinguish good stocks from the bad stocks. To this end, we construct 244

Algorithms ranging from traditional statistical learning methods to recently
popular deep learning method, e.g. Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest
(RF), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and the Stacking, are trained to solve the
classification task. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is also used to implement feature
selection. The effectiveness of the stock selection strategy is validated in
Chinese stock market in both statistical and practical aspects, showing that:
1) Stacking outperforms other models reaching an AUC score of 0.972; 2) Genetic
Algorithm picks a subset of 114 features and the prediction performances of all
models remain almost unchanged after the selection procedure, which suggests
some features are indeed redundant; 3) LR and DNN are radical models; RF is
risk-neutral model; Stacking is somewhere between DNN and RF. 4) The portfolios
constructed by our models outperform market average in back tests.

approximation to compute the loss distribution of the balance sheet of a
financial or an insurance company. We first describe, in a stylised way, the
assets and liabilities dynamics that are used for the numerical estimation of
the balance sheet distribution. For the pricing and hedging model, we chose a
classical Black & Scholes model with a stochastic interest rate following a
Hull & White model. The risk management model describing the evolution of the
parameters of the pricing and hedging model is a Gaussian model. The new
numerical method is compared with the traditional nested simulation approach.
We review the convergence of both methods to estimate the risk indicators under
consideration. Finally, we provide numerical results showing that the sparse
grid approach is extremely competitive for models with moderate dimension.

860,Option market (in)efficiency and implied volatility dynamics after return jumps,"  In informationally efficient financial markets, option prices and this
implied volatility should immediately be adjusted to new information that
arrives along with a jump in underlying's return, whereas gradual changes in
implied volatility would indicate market inefficiency. Using minute-by-minute
data on S&P 500 index options, we provide evidence regarding delayed and
gradual movements in implied volatility after the arrival of return jumps.
These movements are directed and persistent, especially in the case of negative
return jumps. Our results are significant when the implied volatilities are
extracted from at-the-money options and out-of-the-money puts, while the
implied volatility obtained from out-of-the-money calls converges to its new
level immediately rather than gradually. Thus, our analysis reveals that the
implied volatility smile is adjusted to jumps in underlying's return
asymmetrically. Finally, it would be possible to have statistical arbitrage in
zero-transaction-cost option markets, but under actual option price spreads,
our results do not imply abnormal option returns.

presence of fully rational agents (i) accelerates booms (ii) lowers peak prices
and (iii) produces broad, drawn-out, market tops.

general convex bodies, defined as the intersection of a simplex by a family of
parallel hyperplanes, and another family of parallel hyperplanes or a family of
concentric ellipsoids. Such convex bodies appear in modeling and predicting
financial crises. The impact of crises on the economy (labor, income, etc.)
makes its detection of prime interest. Certain features of dependencies in the
markets clearly identify times of turmoil. We describe the relationship between
asset characteristics by means of a copula; each characteristic is either a
linear or quadratic form of the portfolio components, hence the copula can be
constructed by computing volumes of convex bodies. We design and implement
practical algorithms in the exact and approximate setting, we experimentally
juxtapose them and study the tradeoff of exactness and accuracy for speed. We
analyze the following methods in order of increasing generality: rejection
sampling relying on uniformly sampling the simplex, which is the fastest
approach, but inaccurate for small volumes; exact formulae based on the
computation of integrals of probability distribution functions; an optimized
Lawrence sign decomposition method, since the polytopes at hand are shown to be
simple; Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms using random walks based on the
hit-and-run paradigm generalized to nonlinear convex bodies and relying on new
methods for computing a ball enclosed; the latter is experimentally extended to
non-convex bodies with very encouraging results. Our C++ software, based on
CGAL and Eigen and available on github, is shown to be very effective in up to
100 dimensions. Our results offer novel, effective means of computing portfolio
dependencies and an indicator of financial crises, which is shown to correctly
identify past crises.

great necessity for populations, civil authorities as well as the
insurance/reinsurance industry. Koch (2017, 2018) introduced a concept of
spatial risk measure and a related set of axioms which are well-suited to
analyse and quantify the risk due to events having a spatial extent, precisely
such as natural disasters. In this paper, we first carry out a detailed study
of the correlation (and covariance) structure of powers of the Smith and
Brown-Resnick max-stable random fields. Then, using the latter results, we
thoroughly investigate spatial risk measures associated with variance and
induced by powers of max-stable random fields. In addition, we show that
spatial risk measures associated with several classical risk measures and
induced by such cost fields satisfy (at least) part of the previously mentioned
axioms under appropriate conditions on the max-stable fields. Considering such
cost fields is particularly relevant when studying the impact of extreme wind
speeds on buildings and infrastructure.

effect) from two aspects. Firstly, from the viewpoint of dynamics, we study the
existence of the cooling-off effect by following the dynamical evolution of
some financial variables over a period of time before the stock price hits its
limit. Secondly, from the probability perspective, we investigate, with the
logit model, the existence of the cooling-off effect through analyzing the
high-frequency data of all A-share common stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2011 and inspecting the
trading period from the opening phase prior to the moment that the stock price
hits its limits. A comparison is made of the properties between up-limit hits
and down-limit hits, and the possible difference will also be compared between
bullish and bearish market state by dividing the whole period into three
alternating bullish periods and three bearish periods. We find that the
cooling-off effect emerges for both up-limit hits and down-limit hits, and the
cooling-off effect of the down-limit hits is stronger than that of the up-limit
hits. The difference of the cooling-off effect between bullish period and
bearish period is quite modest. Moreover, we examine the sub-optimal orders
effect, and infer that the professional individual investors and institutional
investors play a positive role in the cooling-off effects. All these findings
indicate that the price limit trading rule exerts a positive effect on
maintaining the stability of the Chinese stock markets.

866,Of the People: Voting Is More Effective with Representative Candidates,"  In light of the classic impossibility results of Arrow and Gibbard and
Satterthwaite regarding voting with ordinal rules, there has been recent
interest in characterizing how well common voting rules approximate the social
optimum. In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to
consider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space,
and to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as
compared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to
explore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a
population improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so,
then by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the
metric space?
We restrict attention to the most fundamental and common social choice
setting: a population of voters, two independently drawn candidates, and a
majority rule election. When candidates are not representative of the
population, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be
thrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one. We examine how
this ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population
of voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio
improves from $3$ to $4-2\sqrt{2}$, roughly $1.1716$; this bound is tight. When
the metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of $1.5$ and a constant upper
bound strictly better than $2$ on the approximation ratio of the majority rule.
The positive result depends in part on the assumption that candidates are
independent and identically distributed. However, we show that independence
alone is not enough to achieve the upper bound: even when candidates are drawn
independently, if the population of candidates can be different from the
voters, then an upper bound of $2$ on the approximation is tight.

algorithm for solving a special class of mixed-integer bilevel linear programs
(MIBLPs) where continuous and integer variables are involved in both upper- and
lower-level problems. In particular, we consider MIBLPs with upper-level
constraints that involve lower-level variables. We assume that the inducible
region is nonempty and all variables are bounded. By using the reformulation
and decomposition scheme, an MIBLP is first converted into its equivalent
single-level formulation, then computed by a column-and-constraint generation
based decomposition algorithm. The solution procedure is enhanced by a
projection strategy that does not require the relatively complete response
property. To ensure its performance, we prove that our new method converges to
the global optimal solution in a finite number of iterations. A large-scale
computational study on random instances and instances of hierarchical supply
chain planning are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

establish a natural correspondence between isometric preduals of
$\mathcal{L}(H,Y)$ and isometric preduals of $Y$.
The main ingredient is a Tomiyama-type result which shows that every
contractive projection that complements $\mathcal{L}(H,Y)$ in its bidual is
automatically a right $\mathcal{L}(H)$-module map.
As an application, we show that isometric preduals of
$\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{S}_1)$, the algebra of operators on the space of
trace-class operators, correspond to isometric preduals of $\mathcal{S}_1$
itself (and there is an abundance of them). On the other hand, the compact
operators are the unique predual of $\mathcal{S}_1$ making its multiplication

graphs of paths on an orthogonal grid. The class $B_k$-EPG is the subclass of
EPG graphs where the path on the grid associated to each vertex has at most $k$
bends. Epstein et al. showed in 2013 that computing a maximum clique in
$B_1$-EPG graphs is polynomial. As remarked in [Heldt et al., 2014], when the
number of bends is at least $4$, the class contains $2$-interval graphs for
which computing a maximum clique is an NP-hard problem. The complexity status
of the Maximum Clique problem remains open for $B_2$ and $B_3$-EPG graphs. In
this paper, we show that we can compute a maximum clique in polynomial time in
$B_2$-EPG graphs given a representation of the graph.
Moreover, we show that a simple counting argument provides a
${2(k+1)}$-approximation for the coloring problem on $B_k$-EPG graphs without
knowing the representation of the graph. It generalizes a result of [Epstein et
al, 2013] on $B_1$-EPG graphs (where the representation was needed).

health concerns, believing that common and benign symptoms are explained by
serious illnesses. In this paper, we investigate potential strategies to mine
queries and searcher histories for clues that could help search engines choose
the most appropriate information to present in response to exploratory medical

behavior using the logs of a popular search engine. We found that query

headache"") may hold valuable information about the searcher which could be used
by search engines to improve performance. Furthermore, we investigated how
medically concerned users respond differently to search engine result pages
(SERPs) and find that their disposition for clicking on concerning pages is
pronounced, potentially leading to a self-reinforcement of concern. Finally, we
studied to which degree variations in the SERP impact future search and
real-world health-seeking behavior and obtained some surprising results (e.g.,
viewing concerning pages may lead to a short-term reduction of real-world

$r_i=1$ and $r_o=2$, and periodic in the axial direction with wavelengths
$h\ge100$. The rotation ratio of the inner and outer cylinders is adjusted to
be slightly in the Rayleigh-stable regime, where magnetic fields are required
to destabilize the flow, in this case triggering the axisymmetric helical
magnetorotational instability (HMRI). Two choices of imposed magnetic field are
considered, both having the same azimuthal component $B_\phi=r^{-1}$, but
differing axial components. The first choice has $B_z=0.1$, and yields the
familiar HMRI, consisting of unidirectionally traveling waves. The second

opposite directions depending on the sign of $B_z$. The first configuration
corresponds to a convective instability, the second to an absolute instability.
The two variants behave very similarly regarding both linear onset as well as
nonlinear equilibration.

875,Symmetries and multipeakon solutions for the modified two-component Camassa-Holm system,"  Compared with the two-component Camassa-Holm system, the modified
two-component Camassa-Holm system introduces a regularized density which makes
possible the existence of solutions of lower regularity, and in particular of
multipeakon solutions. In this paper, we derive a new pointwise invariant for
the modified two-component Camassa-Holm system. The derivation of the invariant
uses directly the symmetry of the system, following the classical argument of
Noether's theorem. The existence of the multipeakon solutions can be directly
inferred from this pointwise invariant. This derivation shows the strong
connection between symmetries and the existence of special solutions. The
observation also holds for the scalar Camassa-Holm equation and, for
comparison, we have also included the corresponding derivation. Finally, we
compute explicitly the solutions obtained for the peakon-antipeakon case. We
observe the existence of a periodic solution which has not been reported in the
literature previously. This case shows the attractive effect that the
introduction of an elastic potential can have on the solutions.

876,Selection of quasi-stationary states in the Navier-Stokes equation on the torus,"  The two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on $D_\delta := [0,
2\pi\delta] \times [0, 2\pi]$ with $\delta \approx 1$, periodic boundary
conditions, and viscosity $0 < \nu \ll 1$ is considered. Bars and dipoles, two
explicitly given quasi-stationary states of the system, evolve on the time
scale $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\nu t})$ and have been shown to play a key role in its
long-time evolution. Of particular interest is the role that $\delta$ plays in
selecting which of these two states is observed. Recent numerical studies
suggest that, after a transient period of rapid decay of the high Fourier
modes, the bar state will be selected if $\delta \neq 1$, while the dipole will
be selected if $\delta = 1$. Our results support this claim and seek to
mathematically formalize it. We consider the system in Fourier space, project
it onto a center manifold consisting of the lowest eight Fourier modes, and use
this as a model to study the selection of bars and dipoles. It is shown for
this ODE model that the value of $\delta$ controls the behavior of the
asymptotic ratio of the low modes, thus determining the likelihood of observing
a bar state or dipole after an initial transient period. Moreover, in our
model, for all $\delta \approx 1$, there is an initial time period in which the
high modes decay at the rapid rate $\mathcal{O}(e^{-t/\nu})$, while the low
modes evolve at the slower $\mathcal{O}(e^{-\nu t})$ rate. The results for the
ODE model are proven using energy estimates and invariant manifolds and further
supported by formal asymptotic expansions and numerics.

877,A pliable lasso for the Cox model,"  We introduce a pliable lasso method for estimation of interaction effects in
the Cox proportional hazards model framework. The pliable lasso is a linear
model that includes interactions between covariates X and a set of modifying
variables Z and assumes sparsity of the main effects and interaction effects.
The hierarchical penalty excludes interaction effects when the corresponding
main effects are zero: this avoids overfitting and an explosion of model
complexity. We extend this method to the Cox model for survival data,
incorporating modifiers that are either fixed or varying in time into the
partial likelihood. For example, this allows modeling of survival times that
differ based on interactions of genes with age, gender, or other demographic
information. The optimization is done by blockwise coordinate descent on a
second order approximation of the objective.

878,Localized magnetic moments with tunable spin exchange in a gas of ultracold fermions,"  We report on the experimental realization of a state-dependent lattice for a
two-orbital fermionic quantum gas with strong interorbital spin exchange. In
our state-dependent lattice, the ground and metastable excited electronic
states of $^{173}$Yb take the roles of itinerant and localized magnetic
moments, respectively. Repulsive on-site interactions in conjunction with the
tunnel mobility lead to spin exchange between mobile and localized particles,
modeling the coupling term in the well-known Kondo Hamiltonian. In addition, we
find that this exchange process can be tuned resonantly by varying the on-site
confinement. We attribute this to a resonant coupling to center-of-mass excited
bound states of one interorbital scattering channel.

879,Khintchine's Theorem with random fractions,"  We prove versions of Khintchine's Theorem (1924) for approximations by
rational numbers whose numerators lie in randomly chosen sets of integers, and
we explore the extent to which the monotonicity assumption can be removed.
Roughly speaking, we show that if the number of available fractions for each
denominator grows too fast, then the monotonicity assumption cannot be removed.
There are questions in this random setting which may be seen as cognates of the
Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture (1941), and are likely to be more accessible. We
point out that the direct random analogue of the Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture,
like the Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture itself, implies Catlin's Conjecture
(1976). It is not obvious whether the Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture and its
random version imply one another, and it is not known whether Catlin's
Conjecture implies either of them. The question of whether Catlin implies
Duffin-Schaeffer has been unsettled for decades.

882,Unsupervised Learning of Mixture Regression Models for Longitudinal Data,"  This paper is concerned with learning of mixture regression models for
individuals that are measured repeatedly. The adjective ""unsupervised"" implies
that the number of mixing components is unknown and has to be determined,
ideally by data driven tools. For this purpose, a novel penalized method is
proposed to simultaneously select the number of mixing components and to
estimate the mixing proportions and unknown parameters in the models. The
proposed method is capable of handling both continuous and discrete responses
by only requiring the first two moment conditions of the model distribution. It
is shown to be consistent in both selecting the number of components and
estimating the mixing proportions and unknown regression parameters. Further, a
modified EM algorithm is developed to seamlessly integrate model selection and
estimation. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample
performance of the proposed procedure. And it is further illustrated via an
analysis of a primary biliary cirrhosis data set.

884,Temporal processing and context dependency in C. elegans mechanosensation,"  A quantitative understanding of how sensory signals are transformed into
motor outputs places useful constraints on brain function and helps reveal the
brain's underlying computations. We investigate how the nematode C. elegans
responds to time-varying mechanosensory signals using a high-throughput
optogenetic assay and automated behavior quantification. In the prevailing
picture of the touch circuit, the animal's behavior is determined by which
neurons are stimulated and by the stimulus amplitude. In contrast, we find that
the behavioral response is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory
signals, like its integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds.
Mechanosensory signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit
different behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response
also depends on its behavioral context. Most dramatically, the animal ignores
all tested mechanosensory stimuli during turns. Finally, we present a
linear-nonlinear model that predicts the animal's behavioral response to
stimulus.

Rotenberg and investigated by M. Boulanouar. Here, a cell is characterized by

described by a partial differential equation with a boundary condition. In the

Kelvin's method of images in order to give a new proof that the model is well

model obtained by the method of images in order to give growth estimates for
the semigroup. The main part of the paper is devoted to the asymptotic
behaviour of the semigroup. We formulate conditions for the asymptotic

microscopy based imaging techniques to reduce the time in data acquisition and
to minimize probing radiation in sample exposure. Varies sparse sampling
schemes have been studied and are ideally suited for such applications where
the images can be reconstructed from a sparse set of measurements. Dynamic
sparse sampling methods, particularly supervised learning based iterative
sampling algorithms, have shown promising results for sampling pixel locations
on the edges or boundaries during imaging. However, dynamic sampling for
imaging skeleton-like objects such as metal dendrites remains difficult. Here,
we address a new unsupervised learning approach using Hierarchical Gaussian
Mixture Mod- els (HGMM) to dynamically sample metal dendrites. This technique
is very useful if the users are interested in fast imaging the primary and

888,Long time behavior of Gross-Pitaevskii equation at positive temperature,"  The stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation is used as a model to describe
Bose-Einstein condensation at positive temperature. The equation is a complex
Ginzburg Landau equation with a trapping potential and an additive space-time
white noise. Two important questions for this system are the global existence
of solutions in the support of the Gibbs measure, and the convergence of those
solutions to the equilibrium for large time. In this paper, we give a proof of
these two results in one space dimension. In order to prove the convergence to
equilibrium, we use the associated purely dissipative equation as an auxiliary
equation, for which the convergence may be obtained using standard techniques.
Global existence is obtained for all initial data, and not almost surely with
respect to the invariant measure.

\pmod{\mathbb{Z}}$ and $I-A^{-1}$ is matrix equivalent to $I-B^{-1}$. Combining
this result and an explicit construction of equivariant bimodules, we show that
$\mathcal{A}_{\theta} \rtimes_A\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\theta'} \rtimes_B
\mathbb{Z}$ are Morita equivalent if and only if $\theta$ and $\theta'$ are in
the same $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ orbit and $I-A^{-1}$ is matrix equivalent to

892,Few-shot learning of neural networks from scratch by pseudo example optimization,"  In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method for training neural
networks with a limited amount of training data. Our approach inherits the idea
of knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge from a deep or wide
reference model to a shallow or narrow target model. The proposed method
employs this idea to mimic predictions of reference estimators that are more
robust against overfitting than the network we want to train. Different from
almost all the previous work for knowledge distillation that requires a large
amount of labeled training data, the proposed method requires only a small
amount of training data. Instead, we introduce pseudo training examples that
are optimized as a part of model parameters. Experimental results for several
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed all the
other baselines, such as naive training of the target model and standard
knowledge distillation.

let $\{\lambda_f(n)\}_{n\geq 1}$ be the sequence of its normalized Fourier
coefficients. Motivated by the problem of the first sign change of
$\lambda_f(n)$, we investigate the range of $x$ (in terms of $k$) for which
there are cancellations in the sum $S_f(x)=\sum_{n\leq x} \lambda_f(n)$. We
first show that $S_f(x)=o(x\log x)$ implies that $\lambda_f(n)<0$ for some
$n\leq x$. We also prove that $S_f(x)=o(x\log x)$ in the range $\log x/\log\log
k\to \infty$ assuming the Riemann hypothesis for $L(s, f)$, and furthermore
that this range is best possible unconditionally. More precisely, we establish
the existence of many Hecke cusp forms $f$ of large weight $k$, for which
$S_f(x)\gg_A x\log x$, when $x=(\log k)^A.$ Our results are $GL_2$ analogues of
work of Granville and Soundararajan for character sums, and could also be

singular Riemannian foliations $(M_1,\mathcal{F}_1)$ and $(M_2,\mathcal{F}_2)$

to show that the existence a smooth isometry of leaf spaces as above is not
sufficient to guarantee the equality of $spec_B(M_1,\mathcal{F}_1)$ and
$spec_B(M_2,\mathcal{F}_2).$ The authors then prove that if some additional
conditions involving the geometry of the leaves are satisfied, then the
equality of $spec_B(M_1,\mathcal{F}_1)$ and $spec_B(M_2,\mathcal{F}_2)$ is
guaranteed. Consequences and applications to orbifold spectral theory,

be observed in neuronal activity at different spatiotemporal scales, including
in neuronal membrane potentials, local field potentials,

contemporary neuroscience is to elucidate the functional role of noise in
neuronal information processing. Experimental studies have shown that a
suitable level of noise may enhance the detection of weak neuronal signals by
means of stochastic resonance. In response, theoretical research, based on the

stochastic resonance in neuronal systems. In this perspective, we review recent
research dedicated to neuronal stochastic resonance in biophysical mathematical
models. We also explore the regulation of neuronal stochastic resonance, and we

recommender systems, correlation analysis, signal processing, among others.
Binary matrices are a particular case which has received significant attention
for over thirty years, especially within the field of data mining. Dictionary
learning refers to a family of methods for learning overcomplete basis (also
called frames) in order to efficiently encode samples of a given type; this
area, now also about twenty years old, was mostly developed within the signal
processing field. In this work we propose two binary matrix factorization
methods based on a binary adaptation of the dictionary learning paradigm to
binary matrices. The proposed algorithms focus on speed and scalability; they
work with binary factors combined with bit-wise operations and a few auxiliary
integer ones. Furthermore, the methods are readily applicable to online binary
matrix factorization. Another important issue in matrix factorization is the
choice of rank for the factors; we address this model selection problem with an
efficient method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Our
preliminary results show that the proposed methods are effective at producing
interpretable factorizations of various data types of different nature.

904,The many faces of degeneracy in conic optimization,"  Slater's condition -- existence of a ""strictly feasible solution"" -- is a
common assumption in conic optimization. Without strict feasibility,
first-order optimality conditions may be meaningless, the dual problem may
yield little information about the primal, and small changes in the data may
render the problem infeasible. Hence, failure of strict feasibility can
negatively impact off-the-shelf numerical methods, such as primal-dual interior
point methods, in particular. New optimization modelling techniques and convex
relaxations for hard nonconvex problems have shown that the loss of strict
feasibility is a more pronounced phenomenon than has previously been realized.
In this text, we describe various reasons for the loss of strict feasibility,
whether due to poor modelling choices or (more interestingly) rich underlying
structure, and discuss ways to cope with it and, in many pronounced cases, how
to use it as an advantage. In large part, we emphasize the facial reduction

906,Boundary problems for the fractional and tempered fractional operators,"  For characterizing the Brownian motion in a bounded domain: $\Omega$, it is
well-known that the boundary conditions of the classical diffusion equation
just rely on the given information of the solution along the boundary of a
domain; on the contrary, for the LÃƒÂ©vy flights or tempered LÃƒÂ©vy flights in a
bounded domain, it involves the information of a solution in the complementary
set of $\Omega$, i.e., $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash \Omega$, with the potential
reason that paths of the corresponding stochastic process are discontinuous.
Guided by probability intuitions and the stochastic perspectives of anomalous
diffusion, we show the reasonable ways, ensuring the clear physical meaning and
well-posedness of the partial differential equations (PDEs), of specifying
`boundary' conditions for space fractional PDEs modeling the anomalous
diffusion. Some properties of the operators are discussed, and the
well-posednesses of the PDEs with generalized boundary conditions are proved.

However, their applications are largely limited by the expensive computational
cost of the inference procedures. Existing stochastic or distributed
synchronous variational inferences, although have alleviated this issue by
scaling up GPs to millions of samples, are still far from satisfactory for
real-world large applications, where the data sizes are often orders of

PARAMETERSERVER. ADVGP uses a novel, flexible variational framework based on a
weight space augmentation, and implements the highly efficient, asynchronous
proximal gradient optimization. While maintaining comparable or better
predictive performance, ADVGP greatly improves upon the efficiency of the

regression to a real-world application with billions of samples and demonstrate
an excellent, superior prediction accuracy to the popular linear models.

learning. With hardware accelerators being introduced in datacenter and edge
devices, it is time to acknowledge that hardware specialization is central to
the deep learning system stack.
This technical report presents the Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA), an
open, generic, and customizable deep learning accelerator design. VTA is a
programmable accelerator that exposes a RISC-like programming abstraction to
describe operations at the tensor level. We designed VTA to expose the most
salient and common characteristics of mainstream deep learning accelerators,
such as tensor operations, DMA load/stores, and explicit compute/memory
arbitration.
VTA is more than a standalone accelerator design: it's an end-to-end solution
that includes drivers, a JIT runtime, and an optimizing compiler stack based on
TVM. The current release of VTA includes a behavioral hardware simulator, as
well as the infrastructure to deploy VTA on low-cost FPGA development boards
for fast prototyping.
By extending the TVM stack with a customizable, and open source deep learning
hardware accelerator design, we are exposing a transparent end-to-end deep
learning stack from the high-level deep learning framework, down to the actual
hardware design and implementation. This forms a truly end-to-end, from
software-to-hardware open source stack for deep learning systems.

912,Deep Multimodal Subspace Clustering Networks,"  We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art

patterns of neural activity, as recorded by diverse electrophysiological and
neuroimaging techniques, is a central challenge in neuroscience. Such patterns
include collective oscillations emerging out of neural synchronization as well
as highly heterogeneous outbursts of activity interspersed by periods of
quiescence, called ""neuronal avalanches."" Much debate has been generated about
the possible scale invariance or criticality of such avalanches and its
relevance for brain function. Aimed at shedding light onto this, here we

mesoscopic approach following the principle of parsimony of Landau-Ginzburg.
Our model is similar to that of Wilson-Cowan for neural dynamics but crucially,
includes stochasticity and space; synaptic plasticity and inhibition are
considered as possible regulatory mechanisms. Detailed analyses uncover a phase
diagram including down-state, synchronous, asynchronous, and up-state phases
and reveal that empirical findings for neuronal avalanches are consistently
reproduced by tuning our model to the edge of synchronization. This reveals
that the putative criticality of cortical dynamics does not correspond to a
quiescent-to-active phase transition as usually assumed in theoretical
approaches but to a synchronization phase transition, at which incipient
oscillations and scale-free avalanches coexist. Furthermore, our model also
accounts for up and down states as they occur (e.g., during deep sleep). This
approach constitutes a framework to rationalize the possible collective phases
and phase transitions of cortical networks in simple terms, thus helping to
shed light on basic aspects of brain functioning from a very broad perspective.

914,Well-posedness of a Model for the Growth of Tree Stems and Vines,"  The paper studies a PDE model for the growth of a tree stem or a vine, having
the form of a differential inclusion with state constraints. The equations
describe the elongation due to cell growth, and the response to gravity and to
external obstacles.
The main theorem shows that the evolution problem is well posed, until a
specific ""breakdown configuration"" is reached. A formula is proved,
characterizing the reaction produced by unilateral constraints. At a.e. time t,
this is determined by the minimization of an elastic energy functional under
suitable constraints.

916,Are Thousands of Samples Really Needed to Generate Robust Gene-List for Prediction of Cancer Outcome?,"  The prediction of cancer prognosis and metastatic potential immediately after
the initial diagnoses is a major challenge in current clinical research. The
relevance of such a signature is clear, as it will free many patients from the
agony and toxic side-effects associated with the adjuvant chemotherapy
automatically and sometimes carelessly subscribed to them. Motivated by this
issue, Ein-Dor (2006) and Zuk (2007) presented a Bayesian model which leads to
the following conclusion: Thousands of samples are needed to generate a robust
gene list for predicting outcome. This conclusion is based on existence of some
statistical assumptions. The current work raises doubts over this determination
by showing that: (1) These assumptions are not consistent with additional
assumptions such as sparsity and Gaussianity. (2) The empirical Bayes
methodology which was suggested in order to test the relevant assumptions
doesn't detect severe violations of the model assumptions and consequently an
overestimation of the required sample size might be incurred.

interpolation processing of the original data and is applicable to quite fine
resolution data. The validity of the proposed estimators is shown under the

918,Approximations of the allelic frequency spectrum in general supercritical branching populations,"  We consider a general branching population where the lifetimes of individuals
are i.i.d.\ with arbitrary distribution and where each individual gives birth
to new individuals at Poisson times independently from each other. In addition,
we suppose that individuals experience mutations at Poissonian rate $\theta$
under the infinitely many alleles assumption assuming that types are
transmitted from parents to offspring. This mechanism leads to a partition of
the population by type, called the allelic partition. The main object of this
work is the frequency spectrum $A(k,t)$ which counts the number of families of
size $k$ in the population at time $t$. The process $(A(k,t),\
t\in\mathbb{R}_+)$ is an example of non-Markovian branching process belonging
to the class of general branching processes counted by random characteristics.
In this work, we propose methods of approximation to replace the frequency
spectrum by simpler quantities. Our main goal is study the asymptotic error
made during these approximations through central limit theorems. In a last
section, we perform several numerical analysis using this model, in particular
to analyze the behavior of one of these approximations with respect to Sabeti's
Extended Haplotype Homozygosity [18].

this result, we study nonlinear elasticity problems with respect to these new

920,A probabilistic approach to the leader problem in random graphs,"  Consider the classical Erdos-Renyi random graph process wherein one starts
with an empty graph on $n$ vertices at time $t=0$. At each stage, an edge is
chosen uniformly at random and placed in the graph. After the original
fundamental work in [19], ErdÃ…â€˜s suggested that one should view the original
random graph process as a ""race of components"". This suggested understanding
functionals such as the time for fixation of the identity of the maximal
component, sometimes referred to as the ""leader problem"". Using refined
combinatorial techniques, {\L}uczak [25] provided a complete analysis of this
question including the close relationship to the critical scaling window of the
Erdos-Renyi process. In this paper, we abstract this problem to the context of
the multiplicative coalescent which by the work of Aldous in [3] describes the
evolution of the Erdos-Renyi random graph in the critical regime. Further,
different entrance boundaries of this process have arisen in the study of heavy
tailed network models in the critical regime with degree exponent $\tau \in
(3,4)$. The leader problem in the context of the Erdos-Renyi random graph also
played an important role in the study of the scaling limit of the minimal
spanning tree on the complete graph [2]. In this paper we provide a
probabilistic analysis of the leader problem for the multiplicative coalescent
in the context of entrance boundaries of relevance to critical random graphs.
As a special case we recover {\L}uczak's result in [25] for the Erdos-Renyi
random graph.

922,Identifiability of phylogenetic parameters from k-mer data under the coalescent,"  Distances between sequences based on their $k$-mer frequency counts can be
used to reconstruct phylogenies without first computing a sequence alignment.
Past work has shown that effective use of k-mer methods depends on 1)
model-based corrections to distances based on $k$-mers and 2) breaking long
sequences into blocks to obtain repeated trials from the sequence-generating
process. Good performance of such methods is based on having many high-quality
blocks with many homologous sites, which can be problematic to guarantee a
priori.
Nature provides natural blocks of sequences into homologous regions---namely,
the genes. However, directly using past work in this setting is problematic
because of possible discordance between different gene trees and the underlying
species tree. Using the multispecies coalescent model as a basis, we derive
model-based moment formulas that involve the divergence times and the
coalescent parameters. From this setting, we prove identifiability results for
the tree and branch length parameters under the Jukes-Cantor model of sequence
mutations.

923,Short-Time Nonlinear Effects in the Exciton-Polariton System,"  In the exciton-polariton system, a linear dispersive photon field is coupled
to a nonlinear exciton field. Short-time analysis of the lossless system shows
that, when the photon field is excited, the time required for that field to
exhibit nonlinear effects is longer than the time required for the nonlinear
SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation, in which the photon field itself is nonlinear. When the
initial condition is scaled by $\epsilon^\alpha$, it is found that the relative
error committed by omitting the nonlinear term in the exciton-polariton system
remains within $\epsilon$ for all times up to $t=C\epsilon^\beta$, where
$\beta=(1-\alpha(p-1))/(p+2)$. This is in contrast to $\beta=1-\alpha(p-1)$ for
the nonlinear SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation.

It is shown that Robinson-Trautman metric admits several kinds of

pseudosymmetric, pseudosymmetric Weyl conformal curvature tensor etc. Also it
is shown that the difference $R\cdot R - Q(S,R)$ is linearly dependent with
$Q(g,C)$ but the metric is not Ricci generalized pseudosymmetric. Moreover, it
is proved that this metric is Roter type, 2-quasi-Einstein, Ricci tensor is
Riemann compatible and its Weyl conformal curvature 2-forms are recurrent. It
is also shown that the energy momentum tensor of the metric is pseudosymmetric
and the conditions under which such tensor is of Codazzi type and cyclic
parallel have been investigated. Finally, we have made a comparison between the
curvature properties of Robinson-Trautman metric and Som-Raychaudhuri metric.

space of dimension greater than or equal to 3 is constant during the flexion.
In dimensions 3 and 4 this implies that any flexible polyhedron remains
scissors congruent to itself during the flexion. This proves the Strong Bellows
Conjecture posed by Connelly in 1979. It was believed that this conjecture was
disproved by Alexandrov and Connelly in 2009. However, we find an error in
their counterexample. Further, we show that the Dehn invariant of a flexible
polyhedron in either sphere or Lobachevsky space of dimension greater than or
equal to 3 is constant during the flexion if and only if this polyhedron
satisfies the usual Bellows Conjecture, i.e., its volume is constant during
every flexion of it. Using previous results due to the first listed author, we
deduce that the Dehn invariant is constant during the flexion for every bounded
flexible polyhedron in odd-dimensional Lobachevsky space and for every flexible
polyhedron with sufficiently small edge lengths in any space of constant
curvature of dimension greater than or equal to 3.

926,How Many Subpopulations is Too Many? Exponential Lower Bounds for Inferring Population Histories,"  Reconstruction of population histories is a central problem in population
genetics. Existing coalescent-based methods, like the seminal work of Li and
Durbin (Nature, 2011), attempt to solve this problem using sequence data but
have no rigorous guarantees. Determining the amount of data needed to correctly
reconstruct population histories is a major challenge. Using a variety of tools
from information theory, the theory of extremal polynomials, and approximation
theory, we prove new sharp information-theoretic lower bounds on the problem of
reconstructing population structure -- the history of multiple subpopulations
that merge, split and change sizes over time. Our lower bounds are exponential
in the number of subpopulations, even when reconstructing recent histories. We
demonstrate the sharpness of our lower bounds by providing algorithms for
distinguishing and learning population histories with matching dependence on
the number of subpopulations.

information (e.g., new product launch, quarterly financial report, acquisition
or merger plan) before the information is made public. Detecting illegal
insider trading is difficult due to the complex, nonlinear, and non-stationary
nature of the stock market. In this work, we present an approach that detects

sources of structured and unstructured data using a deep-learning based
approach combined with discrete signal processing on the time series data. In
addition, we use a tree-based approach that visualizes events and actions to
aid analysts in their understanding of large amounts of unstructured data.
Using existing data, we have discovered that our approach has a good success
rate in detecting illegal insider trading patterns.

component results in improved model accuracy and interpretability, despite the
concept of attention in these approaches only loosely approximating the brain's
attention mechanism. Here we extend this work by building a more brain-inspired
deep network model of the primate ATTention Network (ATTNet) that learns to
shift its attention so as to maximize the reward. Using deep reinforcement
learning, ATTNet learned to shift its attention to the visual features of a
target category in the context of a search task. ATTNet's dorsal layers also
learned to prioritize these shifts of attention so as to maximize success of
the ventral pathway classification and receive greater reward. Model behavior
was tested against the fixations made by subjects searching images for the same
cued category. Both subjects and ATTNet showed evidence for attention being
preferentially directed to target goals, behaviorally measured as oculomotor
guidance to targets. More fundamentally, ATTNet learned to shift its attention
to target like objects and spatially route its visual inputs to accomplish the
task. This work makes a step toward a better understanding of the role of
attention in the brain and other computational systems.

wavelet-Laguerre estimator is adaptive and asymptotically near-optimal in a
wide range of Laguerre-Sobolev spaces. We carry out a limited simulations study

we use the technique for the solution of the Laplace deconvolution problem on

which could be useful in the clinical practice. We use a supervised learning

to enhance the classification performance (Ensemble learning) and complement
each prediction with a measure of credibility (Conformal Predictors). Our

functions of the first kind which arises in the study of Dunkl operators
associated with dihedral groups and as an instance of the Laguerre semigroup
constructed by Ben Said-Kobayashi-Orsted. We first revisit the particular case
corresponding to the group of square-preserving symmetries for which we give
two new and different proofs other than the existing ones. The first proof uses
the expansion of powers in a Neumann series of Bessel functions while the
second one is based on a quadratic transformation for the Gauss hypergeometric
function and opens the way to derive further expressions when the orders of the
underlying dihedral groups are powers of two. More generally, we give another
proof of De Bie \& al formula expressing this series as a $\Phi_2$-Horn
confluent hypergeometric function. In the course of proving, we shed the light
on the occurrence of multiple angles in their formula through elementary
symmetric functions, and get a new representation of Gegenbauer polynomials.

935,Towards a realistic NNLIF model: Analysis and numerical solver for excitatory-inhibitory networks with delay and refractory periods,"  The Network of Noisy Leaky Integrate and Fire (NNLIF) model describes the
behavior of a neural network at mesoscopic level. It is one of the simplest
self-contained mean-field models considered for that purpose. Even so, to study
the mathematical properties of the model some simplifications were necessary
CÃƒÂ¡ceres-Carrillo-Perthame(2011), CÃƒÂ¡ceres-Perthame(2014),
CÃƒÂ¡ceres-Schneider(2017), which disregard crucial phenomena. In this work we
deal with the general NNLIF model without simplifications. It involves a
network with two populations (excitatory and inhibitory), with transmission
delays between the neurons and where the neurons remain in a refractory state
for a certain time. We have studied the number of steady states in terms of the
model parameters, the long time behaviour via the entropy method and
PoincarÃƒÂ©'s inequality, blow-up phenomena, and the importance of transmission
delays between excitatory neurons to prevent blow-up and to give rise to
synchronous solutions. Besides analytical results, we have presented a
numerical resolutor for this model, based on high order flux-splitting WENO
schemes and an explicit third order TVD Runge-Kutta method, in order to
describe the wide range of phenomena exhibited by the network: blow-up,
asynchronous/synchronous solutions and instability/stability of the steady
states; the solver also allows us to observe the time evolution of the firing
rates, refractory states and the probability distributions of the excitatory
and inhibitory populations.

$\Gamma$-closure of sets. We use this condition to show that given a set
$\mathcal{U}$ of distinguished joins from $P$, the lattice of
$\mathcal{U}$-ideals of $P$ fails to be a frame if and only if it fails to be
$\sigma$-distributive, with $\sigma$ depending on the cardinalities of sets in
$\mathcal{U}$. From this we deduce that if a poset has the property that
whenever $a\wedge(b\vee c)$ is defined for $a,b,c\in P$ it is necessarily equal
to $(a\wedge b)\vee (a\wedge c)$, then it has an $(\omega,3)$-representation.

We propose a general learning framework for modeling agent behavior in any
multiagent system using only a handful of interaction data. Our framework casts
agent modeling as a representation learning problem. Consequently, we construct
a novel objective inspired by imitation learning and agent identification and
design an algorithm for unsupervised learning of representations of agent

control and (ii) a cooperative environment for communication, on supervised

$\mathbb{R}^n$ that give rise to a nonlocal minimal graph over a ball of
$\mathbb{R}^n$. We establish that the gradient of any such function is bounded
in the interior of the ball by a power of its oscillation. This estimate,
together with previously known results, leads to the $C^\infty$ regularity of
the function in the ball. While the smoothness of nonlocal minimal graphs was
known for $n = 1, 2$ (but without a quantitative bound), in higher dimensions
only their continuity had been established.
To prove the gradient bound, we show that the normal to a nonlocal minimal
graph is a supersolution of a truncated fractional Jacobi operator, for which
we prove a weak Harnack inequality. To this end, we establish a new universal
fractional Sobolev inequality on nonlocal minimal surfaces.
Our estimate provides an extension to the fractional setting of the
celebrated gradient bounds of Finn and of Bombieri, De Giorgi & Miranda for
solutions of the classical mean curvature equation.

941,Injective stabilization of additive functors. I. Preliminaries,"  This paper is the first one in a series of three dealing with the concept of
injective stabilization of the tensor product and its applications. Its primary
goal is to collect known facts and establish a basic operational calculus that
will be used in the subsequent parts. This is done in greater generality than
is necessary for the stated goal. Several results of independent interest are
also established. They include, among other things, connections with
satellites, an explicit construction of the stabilization of a finitely
presented functor, various exactness properties of the injectively stable
functors, a construction, from a functor and a short exact sequence, of a
doubly-infinite exact sequence by splicing the injective stabilization of the
functor and its derived functors. When specialized to the tensor product with a
finitely presented module, the injective stabilization with coefficients in the
ring is isomorphic to the 1-torsion functor. The Auslander-Reiten formula is
extended to a more general formula, which holds for arbitrary (i.e., not
necessarily finite) modules over arbitrary associative rings with identity.
Weakening of the assumptions in the theorems of Eilenberg and Watts leads to
characterizations of the requisite zeroth derived functors.
The subsequent papers, provide applications of the developed techniques.
Part~II deals with new notions of torsion module and cotorsion module of a
module. This is done for arbitrary modules over arbitrary rings. Part~III
introduces a new concept, called the asymptotic stabilization of the tensor
product. The result is closely related to different variants of stable homology
(these are generalizations of Tate homology to arbitrary rings). A comparison
transformation from Vogel homology to the asymptotic stabilization of the
tensor product is constructed and shown to be epic.

approximators such as tile coding or their generalisations, radial basis
functions (RBF) because they introduce instability due to the side effect of
globalised updates present in neural networks. This instability does not even
vanish in neural networks that do not have any hidden layers. In this paper, we
show that simple modifications to the structure of the neural network can
improve stability of DQN learning when a multi-layer perceptron is used for

943,Generalizing Geometric Brownian Motion,"  To convert standard Brownian motion $Z$ into a positive process, Geometric
Brownian motion (GBM) $e^{\beta Z_t}, \beta >0$ is widely used. We generalize
this positive process by introducing an asymmetry parameter $ \alpha \geq 0$
which describes the instantaneous volatility whenever the process reaches a new
low. For our new process, $\beta$ is the instantaneous volatility as prices
become arbitrarily high. Our generalization preserves the positivity, constant
proportional drift, and tractability of GBM, while expressing the instantaneous
volatility as a randomly weighted $L^2$ mean of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The
running minimum and relative drawup of this process are also analytically
tractable. Letting $\alpha = \beta$, our positive process reduces to Geometric
Brownian motion. By adding a jump to default to the new process, we introduce a
non-negative martingale with the same tractabilities. Assuming a security's
dynamics are driven by these processes in risk neutral measure, we price

back-end, including state-of-the-art solvers and entropically penalized
versions. It is based on averaging the exact distances between empirical
measures generated from independent samples from the original measures and can
easily be tuned towards higher accuracy or shorter computation times. To this
end, we give non-asymptotic deviation bounds for its accuracy in the case of
discrete optimal transport problems. In particular, we show that in many
important instances, including images (2D-histograms), the approximation error
is independent of the size of the full problem. We present numerical
experiments that demonstrate that a very good approximation in typical
applications can be obtained in a computation time that is several orders of
magnitude smaller than what is required for exact computation of the full

certain self-affine measures in ${\Bbb R}^d$ and the dimensional regularity of

949,Option Pricing in Illiquid Markets with Jumps,"  The classical linear Black--Scholes model for pricing derivative securities
is a popular model in financial industry. It relies on several restrictive
assumptions such as completeness, and frictionless of the market as well as the
assumption on the underlying asset price dynamics following a geometric
Brownian motion. The main purpose of this paper is to generalize the classical
Black--Scholes model for pricing derivative securities by taking into account
feedback effects due to an influence of a large trader on the underlying asset
price dynamics exhibiting random jumps. The assumption that an investor can
trade large amounts of assets without affecting the underlying asset price
itself is usually not satisfied, especially in illiquid markets. We generalize
the Frey--Stremme nonlinear option pricing model for the case the underlying
asset follows a Levy stochastic process with jumps. We derive and analyze a
fully nonlinear parabolic partial-integro differential equation for the price
of the option contract. We propose a semi-implicit numerical discretization
scheme and perform various numerical experiments showing influence of a large
trader and intensity of jumps on the option price.

950,An Enhanced Initial Margin Methodology to Manage Warehoused Credit Risk,"  The use of CVA to cover credit risk is widely spread, but has its
limitations. Namely, dealers face the problem of the illiquidity of instruments
used for hedging it, hence forced to warehouse credit risk. As a result,
dealers tend to offer a limited OTC derivatives market to highly risky
counterparties. Consequently, those highly risky entities rarely have access to
hedging services precisely when they need them most. In this paper we propose a
method to overcome this limitation. We propose to extend the CVA risk-neutral
framework to compute an initial margin (IM) specific to each counterparty,
which depends on the credit quality of the entity at stake, transforming the
effective credit rating of a given netting set to AAA, regardless of the credit
rating of the counterparty. By transforming CVA requirement into IM ones, as
proposed in this paper, an institution could rely on the existing mechanisms
for posting and calling of IM, hence ensuring the operational viability of this
new form of managing warehoused risk. The main difference with the currently
standard framework is the creation of a Specific Initial Margin, that depends
in the credit rating of the counterparty and the characteristics of the netting
set in question. In this paper we propose a methodology for such transformation
in a sound manner, and hence this method overcomes some of the limitations of
the CVA framework.

951,Economic Implications of Blockchain Platforms,"  In an economy with asymmetric information, the smart contract in the
blockchain protocol mitigates uncertainty. Since, as a new trading platform,
the blockchain triggers segmentation of market and differentiation of agents in
both the sell and buy sides of the market, it recomposes the asymmetric
information and generates spreads in asset price and quality between itself and
a traditional platform. We show that marginal innovation and sophistication of
the smart contract have non-monotonic effects on the trading value in the
blockchain platform, its fundamental value, the price of cryptocurrency, and
consumers' welfare. Moreover, a blockchain manager who controls the level of
the innovation of the smart contract has an incentive to keep it lower than the
first best when the underlying information asymmetry is not severe, leading to
welfare loss for consumers.

952,Target volatility option pricing in lognormal fractional SABR model,"  We examine in this article the pricing of target volatility options in the
lognormal fractional SABR model. A decomposition formula by Ito's calculus
yields a theoretical replicating strategy for the target volatility option,
assuming the accessibilities of all variance swaps and swaptions. The same
formula also suggests an approximation formula for the price of target
volatility option in small time by the technique of freezing the coefficient.
Alternatively, we also derive closed formed expressions for a small volatility
of volatility expansion of the price of target volatility option. Numerical
experiments show accuracy of the approximations in a reasonably wide range of
parameters.

953,Reframing the S\&P500 Network of Stocks along the \nth{21} Century,"  Since the beginning of the new millennium, stock markets went through every
state from long-time troughs, trade suspensions to all-time highs. The
literature on asset pricing hence assumes random processes to be underlying the
movement of stock returns. Observed procyclicality and time-varying correlation
of stock returns tried to give the apparently random behavior some sort of
structure. However, common misperceptions about the co-movement of asset prices
in the years preceding the \emph{Great Recession} and the \emph{Global
Commodity Crisis}, is said to have even fueled the crisis' economic impact.
Here we show how a varying macroeconomic environment influences stocks'
clustering into communities. From a sample of 296 stocks of the S\&P 500 index,
distinct periods in between 2004 and 2011 are used to develop networks of
stocks. The Minimal Spanning Tree analysis of those time-varying networks of
stocks demonstrates that the crises of 2007-2008 and 2010-2011 drove the market
to clustered community structures in both periods, helping to restore the stock
market's ceased order of the pre-crises era. However, a comparison of the
emergent clusters with the \textit{General Industry Classification Standard}
conveys the impression that industry sectors do not play a major role in that
order.

954,Affine processes under parameter uncertainty,"  We develop a one-dimensional notion of affine processes under parameter
uncertainty, which we call non-linear affine processes. This is done as
follows: given a set of parameters for the process, we construct a
corresponding non-linear expectation on the path space of continuous processes.
By a general dynamic programming principle we link this non-linear expectation
to a variational form of the Kolmogorov equation, where the generator of a
single affine process is replaced by the supremum over all corresponding
generators of affine processes with parameters in the parameter set. This
non-linear affine process yields a tractable model for Knightian uncertainty,
especially for modelling interest rates under ambiguity.
We then develop an appropriate Ito-formula, the respective term-structure
equations and study the non-linear versions of the Vasicek and the
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. Thereafter we introduce the non-linear
Vasicek-CIR model. This model is particularly suitable for modelling interest
rates when one does not want to restrict the state space a priori and hence the
approach solves this modelling issue arising with negative interest rates.

955,Empirical Survival Jensen-Shannon Divergence as a Goodness-of-Fit Measure for Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Curve Fitting,"  The coefficient of determination, known as $R^2$, is commonly used as a
goodness-of-fit criterion for fitting linear models. $R^2$ is somewhat
controversial when fitting nonlinear models, although it may be generalised on
a case-by-case basis to deal with specific models such as the logistic model.
Assume we are fitting a parametric distribution to a data set using, say, the
maximum likelihood estimation method. A general approach to measure the
goodness-of-fit of the fitted parameters, which we advocate herein, is to use a
nonparametric measure for model comparison between the raw data and the fitted
model. In particular, for this purpose we put forward the {\em Survival
Jensen-Shannon divergence} ($SJS$) and its empirical counterpart (${\cal
E}SJS$) as a metric which is bounded, and is a natural generalisation of the
Jensen-Shannon divergence. We demonstrate, via a straightforward procedure
making use of the ${\cal E}SJS$, that it can be used as part of maximum
likelihood estimation or curve fitting as a measure of goodness-of-fit,
including the construction of a confidence interval for the fitted parametric
distribution. Furthermore, we show the validity of the proposed method with
simulated data, and three empirical data sets of interest to researchers in
sociophysics and econophysics.

956,How spread changes affect the order book: Comparing the price responses of order deletions and placements to trades,"  We observe the effects of the three different events that cause spread
changes in the order book, namely trades, deletions and placement of limit
orders. By looking at the frequencies of the relative amounts of price changing
events, we discover that deletions of orders open the bid-ask spread of a stock
more often than trades do. We see that once the amount of spread changes due to
deletions exceeds the amount of the ones due to trades, other observables in
the order book change as well. We then look at how these spread changing events
affect the prices of stocks, by means of the price response. We not only see
that the self-response of stocks is positive for both spread changing trades
and deletions and negative for order placements, but also cross-response to
other stocks and therefore the market as a whole. In addition, the
self-response function of spread-changing trades is similar to that of all
trades. This leads to the conclusion that spread changing deletions and order
placements have a similar effect on the order book and stock prices over time
as trades.

958,Seasonal Stochastic Volatility and the Samuelson Effect in Agricultural Futures Markets,"  We introduce a multi-factor stochastic volatility model for commodities that
incorporates seasonality and the Samuelson effect. Conditions on the seasonal
term under which the corresponding volatility factor is well-defined are given,
and five different specifications of the seasonality pattern are proposed. We
calculate the joint characteristic function of two futures prices for different
maturities in the risk-neutral measure. The model is then presented under the
physical measure, and its state-space representation is derived, in order to
estimate the parameters with the Kalman filter for time series of corn, cotton,
soybean, sugar and wheat futures from 2007 to 2017. The seasonal model
significantly outperforms the nested non-seasonal model in all five markets,
and we show which seasonality patterns are particularly well-suited in each
case. We also confirm the importance of correctly modelling the Samuelson
effect in order to account for futures with different maturities. Our results
are clearly confirmed in a robustness check carried out with an alternative
dataset of constant maturity futures for the same agricultural markets.

959,An optimization approach to adaptive multi-dimensional capital management,"  Firms should keep capital to offer sufficient protection against the risks
they are facing. In the insurance context methods have been developed to
determine the minimum capital level required, but less so in the context of
firms with multiple business lines including allocation. The individual capital
reserve of each line can be represented by means of classical models, such as
the conventional CramÃƒÂ©r-Lundberg model, but the challenge lies in soundly
modelling the correlations between the business lines. We propose a simple yet
versatile approach that allows for dependence by introducing a common
environmental factor. We present a novel Bayesian approach to calibrate the
latent environmental state distribution based on observations concerning the
claim processes. The calibration approach is adjusted for an environmental
factor that changes over time. The convergence of the calibration procedure
towards the true environmental state is deduced. We then point out how to
determine the optimal initial capital of the different business lines under
specific constraints on the ruin probability of subsets of business lines. Upon
combining the above findings, we have developed an easy-to-implement approach
to capital risk management in a multi-dimensional insurance risk model.

960,Multilevel nested simulation for efficient risk estimation,"  We investigate the problem of computing a nested expectation of the form
$\mathbb{P}[\mathbb{E}[X|Y]
\!\geq\!0]\!=\!\mathbb{E}[\textrm{H}(\mathbb{E}[X|Y])]$ where $\textrm{H}$ is
the Heaviside function. This nested expectation appears, for example, when
estimating the probability of a large loss from a financial portfolio. We
present a method that combines the idea of using Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)
for nested expectations with the idea of adaptively selecting the number of
samples in the approximation of the inner expectation, as proposed by (Broadie
et al., 2011). We propose and analyse an algorithm that adaptively selects the
number of inner samples on each MLMC level and prove that the resulting MLMC
method with adaptive sampling has an $\mathcal{O}\left(
\varepsilon^{-2}|\log\varepsilon|^2 \right)$ complexity to achieve a root
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$. The theoretical analysis is verified by
numerical experiments on a simple model problem. We also present a stochastic
root-finding algorithm that, combined with our adaptive methods, can be used to
compute other risk measures such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional
Value-at-Risk (CVaR), with the latter being achieved with
$\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ complexity.

provide practical advice for the design of the empirical strategy and discuss

structure model of joint credit migrations, our evaluation of DF takes into
account the joint credit quality of clearing members as they evolve over time.
Another important aspect of the proposed methodology is the use of the time
consistent dynamic risk measures for computation of IM and DF. We carry out a
comprehensive numerical study, where, in particular, we analyze the advantages
of the proposed methodology and its comparison with the currently prevailing

964,Bayesian adaptive bandit-based designs using the Gittins index for multi-armed trials with normally distributed endpoints,"  Adaptive designs for multi-armed clinical trials have become increasingly
popular recently in many areas of medical research because of their potential
to shorten development times and to increase patient response. However,
developing response-adaptive trial designs that offer patient benefit while
ensuring the resulting trial avoids bias and provides a statistically rigorous
comparison of the different treatments included is highly challenging. In this
paper, the theory of Multi-Armed Bandit Problems is used to define a family of
near optimal adaptive designs in the context of a clinical trial with a
normally distributed endpoint with known variance. Through simulation studies
based on an ongoing trial as a motivation we report the operating
characteristics (type I error, power, bias) and patient benefit of these
approaches and compare them to traditional and existing alternative designs.
These results are then compared to those recently published in the context of
Bernoulli endpoints. Many limitations and advantages are similar in both cases
but there are also important differences, specially with respect to type I
error control. This paper proposes a simulation-based testing procedure to
correct for the observed type I error inflation that bandit-based and adaptive
rules can induce. Results presented extend recent work by considering a
normally distributed endpoint, a very common case in clinical practice yet
mostly ignored in the response-adaptive theoretical literature, and illustrate
the potential advantages of using these methods in a rare disease context. We
also recommend a suitable modified implementation of the bandit-based adaptive
designs for the case of common diseases.

965,Strong Convergence Rate of Splitting Schemes for Stochastic Nonlinear SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger Equations,"  We prove the optimal strong convergence rate of a fully discrete scheme,
based on a splitting approach, for a stochastic nonlinear SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger (NLS)
equation. The main novelty of our method lies on the uniform a priori estimate
and exponential integrability of a sequence of splitting processes which are
used to approximate the solution of the stochastic NLS equation. We show that
the splitting processes converge to the solution with strong order $1/2$. Then
we use the Crank--Nicolson scheme to temporally discretize the splitting
process and get the temporal splitting scheme which also possesses strong order
$1/2$. To obtain a full discretization, we apply this splitting Crank--Nicolson
scheme to the spatially discrete equation which is achieved through the
spectral Galerkin approximation. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of
this fully discrete scheme with optimal strong convergence rate
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-2}+\tau^\frac12)$, where $N$ denotes the dimension of the
approximate space and $\tau$ denotes the time step size. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first result about strong convergence rates of
temporally numerical approximations and fully discrete schemes for stochastic
NLS equations, or even for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs)
with non-monotone coefficients. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical
result.

966,Controllability of Conjunctive Boolean Networks with Application to Gene Regulation,"  A Boolean network is a finite state discrete time dynamical system. At each
step, each variable takes a value from a binary set. The value update rule for
each variable is a local function which depends only on a selected subset of
variables. Boolean networks have been used in modeling gene regulatory
networks. We focus in this paper on a special class of Boolean networks, namely
the conjunctive Boolean networks (CBNs), whose value update rule is comprised
of only logic AND operations. It is known that any trajectory of a Boolean
network will enter a periodic orbit. Periodic orbits of a CBN have been
completely understood. In this paper, we investigate the orbit-controllability
and state-controllability of a CBN: We ask the question of how one can steer a
CBN to enter any periodic orbit or to reach any final state, from any initial
state. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a CBN to be
orbit-controllable and state-controllable. Furthermore, explicit control laws
are presented along the analysis.

967,Characterizing the impact of model error in hydrogeologic time series recovery inverse problems,"  Hydrogeologic models are commonly over-smoothed relative to reality, owing to
the difficulty of obtaining accurate high-resolution information about the
subsurface. When used in an inversion context, such models may introduce
systematic biases which cannot be encapsulated by an unbiased ""observation
noise"" term of the type assumed by standard regularization theory and typical
Bayesian formulations. Despite its importance, model error is difficult to
encapsulate systematically and is often neglected. Here, model error is
considered for a hydrogeologically important class of inverse problems that
includes interpretation of hydraulic transients and contaminant source history
inference: reconstruction of a time series that has been convolved against a
transfer function (i.e., impulse response) that is only approximately known.
Using established harmonic theory along with two results established here
regarding triangular Toeplitz matrices, upper and lower error bounds are
derived for the effect of systematic model error on time series recovery for
both well-determined and over-determined inverse problems. A Monte Carlo study
of a realistic hydraulic reconstruction problem is presented, and the lower
error bound is seen informative about expected behavior. A possible diagnostic
criterion for blind transfer function characterization is also uncovered.

These are the non-archimedean analytic spaces which admit an affine special
formal scheme as model over a complete discrete valuation ring, such as for
example open or closed polydiscs or polyannuli. Using Weil restrictions and
Galois fixed loci for semi-affinoid spaces and their formal models, we describe
a formal model of a $K$-analytic space $X$, provided that $X\otimes_KL$ is
semi-affinoid for some finite tamely ramified extension $L$ of $K$. As an
application, we study the forms of analytic annuli that are trivialized by a
wide class of Galois extensions that includes totally tamely ramified
extensions. In order to do so, we first establish a Weierstrass preparation
result for analytic functions on annuli, and use it to linearize finite order
automorphisms of annuli. Finally, we explain how from these results one can
deduce a non-archimedean analytic proof of the existence of resolutions of
singularities of surfaces in characteristic zero.

We introduce the relative singularity category as the Verdier quotient of the
bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on A modulo the category of
perfect complexes on X. We view it as a measure for the difference between X
and A. The main results of this thesis are the following.
(i) We prove an analogue of Orlov's localization result in our setup. If X
has isolated singularities, then this reduces the study of the relative
singularity categories to the affine case.
(ii) We prove Hom-finiteness and idempotent completeness of the relative
singularity categories in the complete local situation and determine its
Grothendieck group.
(iii) We give a complete and explicit description of the relative singularity
categories when X has only nodal singularities and the resolution is given by a
sheaf of Auslander algebras.
(iv) We study relations between relative singularity categories and classical
singularity categories. For a simple hypersurface singularity and its Auslander
resolution, we show that these categories determine each other.
(v) The developed technique leads to the following `purely commutative'
application: a description of Iyama & Wemyss triangulated category for rational
surface singularities in terms of the singularity category of the rational
double point resolution.
(vi) We give a description of singularity categories of gentle algebras.

972,The coordination of centralised and distributed generation,"  In this paper, we analyse the interaction between centralised carbon emissive
technologies and distributed intermittent non-emissive technologies. A
representative consumer can satisfy his electricity demand by investing in
distributed generation (solar panels) and by buying power from a centralised
firm at a price the firm sets. Distributed generation is intermittent and
induces an externality cost to the consumer. The firm provides non-random
electricity generation subject to a carbon tax and to transmission costs. The
objective of the consumer is to satisfy her demand while minimising investment
costs, payments to the firm, and intermittency costs. The objective of the firm
is to satisfy the consumer's residual demand while minimising investment costs,
demand deviation costs, and maximising the payments from the consumer. We
formulate the investment decisions as McKean-Vlasov control problems with
stochastic coefficients. We provide explicit, price model-free solutions to the
optimal decision problems faced by each player, the solution of the Pareto
optimum, and the laissez-faire market situation represented by a Stackelberg
equilibrium where the firm is the leader. We find that, from the social
planner's point of view, the high adjustment cost of centralised technology
damages the development of distributed generation. The Stackelberg equilibrium
leads to significant deviation from the socially desirable ratio of centralised
versus distributed generation. In a situation where a power system is to be
built from zero, the optimal strategy of the firm is high price/low
market-share, but is low price/large market share for existing power systems.
Further, from a regulation policy, we find that a carbon tax or a subsidy to
distributed technology has the same efficiency in achieving a given level of
distributed generation.

make conceptual leaps, creating something surprising from typical knowledge. In
comparison, deep neural networks often struggle to handle cases outside of
their training data, which is especially problematic for problems with limited
training data. Approaches exist to transfer knowledge from problems with
sufficient data to those with insufficient data, but they tend to require
additional training or a domain-specific method of transfer. We present a new
approach, conceptual expansion, that serves as a general representation for
reusing existing trained models to derive new models without backpropagation.
We evaluate our approach on few-shot variations of two tasks: image
classification and image generation, and outperform standard transfer learning
approaches.

can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of frequency-dependent polarization
attributes. A natural decomposition of any random bivariate signal in terms of
unpolarized and polarized components is introduced. Nonparametric spectral

periodogram of a random bivariate signal. Numerical experiments support our

977,Modularity of complex networks models,"  Modularity is designed to measure the strength of division of a network into
clusters (known also as communities). Networks with high modularity have dense
connections between the vertices within clusters but sparse connections between
vertices of different clusters. As a result, modularity is often used in
optimization methods for detecting community structure in networks, and so it
is an important graph parameter from a practical point of view. Unfortunately,
many existing non-spatial models of complex networks do not generate graphs
with high modularity; on the other hand, spatial models naturally create
clusters. We investigate this phenomenon by considering a few examples from
both sub-classes. We prove precise theoretical results for the classical model
of random d-regular graphs as well as the preferential attachment model, and
contrast these results with the ones for the spatial preferential attachment
(SPA) model that is a model for complex networks in which vertices are embedded
in a metric space, and each vertex has a sphere of influence whose size
increases if the vertex gains an in-link, and otherwise decreases with time.
The results obtained in this paper can be used for developing statistical tests
for models selection and to measure statistical significance of clusters
observed in complex networks.

Yet, human neuroimaging studies of visual perception still rely on small
numbers of images (around 100) due to time-constrained experimental procedures.
To apply statistical learning approaches that integrate neuroscience, the
number of images used in neuroimaging must be significantly increased. We
present BOLD5000, a human functional MRI (fMRI) study that includes almost
5,000 distinct images depicting real-world scenes. Beyond dramatically
increasing image dataset size relative to prior fMRI studies, BOLD5000 also
accounts for image diversity, overlapping with standard computer vision
datasets by incorporating images from the Scene UNderstanding (SUN), Common

these image datasets, combined with a slow event-related fMRI design, enable
fine-grained exploration into the neural representation of a wide range of

980,Protein Folding and Machine Learning: Fundamentals,"  In spite of decades of research, much remains to be discovered about folding:
the detailed structure of the initial (unfolded) state, vestigial folding
instructions remaining only in the unfolded state, the interaction of the
molecule with the solvent, instantaneous power at each point within the
molecule during folding, the fact that the process is stable in spite of myriad
possible disturbances, potential stabilization of trajectory by chaos, and, of
course, the exact physical mechanism (code or instructions) by which the
folding process is specified in the amino acid sequence. Simulations based upon
microscopic physics have had some spectacular successes and continue to
improve, particularly as super-computer capabilities increase. The simulations,
exciting as they are, are still too slow and expensive to deal with the
enormous number of molecules of interest. In this paper, we introduce an
approximate model based upon physics, empirics, and information science which
is proposed for use in machine learning applications in which very large
numbers of sub-simulations must be made. In particular, we focus upon machine
learning applications in the learning phase and argue that our model is
sufficiently close to the physics that, in spite of its approximate nature, can
facilitate stepping through machine learning solutions to explore the mechanics
of folding mentioned above. We particularly emphasize the exploration of energy
flow (power) within the molecule during folding, the possibility of energy
scale invariance (above a threshold), vestigial information in the unfolded
state as attractive targets for such machine language analysis, and statistical
analysis of an ensemble of folding micro-steps.

everywhere unramified. Under the classical $\mu=0$ hypothesis we give a proof
which mainly relies on the interpretation of the Selmer complex in terms of
$p$-adic cohomology [TV] together with the trace formulas of [EL1].

982,Conditional Time Series Forecasting with Convolutional Neural Networks,"  We present a method for conditional time series forecasting based on an
adaptation of the recent deep convolutional WaveNet architecture. The proposed
network contains stacks of dilated convolutions that allow it to access a broad
range of history when forecasting, a ReLU activation function and conditioning
is performed by applying multiple convolutional filters in parallel to separate
time series which allows for the fast processing of data and the exploitation
of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. We test and
analyze the performance of the convolutional network both unconditionally as
well as conditionally for financial time series forecasting using the S&P500,
the volatility index, the CBOE interest rate and several exchange rates and
extensively compare it to the performance of the well-known autoregressive
model and a long-short term memory network. We show that a convolutional
network is well-suited for regression-type problems and is able to effectively
learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for long
historical time series, is a time-efficient and easy to implement alternative
to recurrent-type networks and tends to outperform linear and recurrent models.

985,Domain Generalization by Marginal Transfer Learning,"  Domain generalization is the problem of assigning class labels to an
unlabeled test data set, given several labeled training data sets drawn from
similar distributions. This problem arises in several applications where data
distributions fluctuate because of biological, technical, or other sources of
variation. We develop a distribution-free, kernel-based approach that predicts
a classifier from the marginal distribution of features, by leveraging the
trends present in related classification tasks. This approach involves
identifying an appropriate reproducing kernel Hilbert space and optimizing a
regularized empirical risk over the space. We present generalization error
analysis, describe universal kernels, and establish universal consistency of
the proposed methodology. Experimental results on synthetic data and three real
data applications demonstrate the superiority of the method with respect to a
pooling strategy.

987,Pricing options and computing implied volatilities using neural networks,"  This paper proposes a data-driven approach, by means of an Artificial Neural
Network (ANN), to value financial options and to calculate implied volatilities
with the aim of accelerating the corresponding numerical methods. With ANNs
being universal function approximators, this method trains an optimized ANN on
a data set generated by a sophisticated financial model, and runs the trained
ANN as an agent of the original solver in a fast and efficient way. We test
this approach on three different types of solvers, including the analytic
solution for the Black-Scholes equation, the COS method for the Heston
stochastic volatility model and Brent's iterative root-finding method for the
calculation of implied volatilities. The numerical results show that the ANN
solver can reduce the computing time significantly.

988,Quantitative evaluation of an active Chemotaxis model in Discrete time,"  A system of $N$ particles in a chemical medium in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is studied
in a discrete time setting. Underlying interacting particle system in
continuous time can be expressed as \begin{eqnarray} dX_{i}(t)
&=&[-(I-A)X_{i}(t) + \bigtriangledown h(t,X_{i}(t))]dt + dW_{i}(t), \,\,
X_{i}(0)=x_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{d}\,\,\forall i=1,\ldots,N\nonumber\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} h(t,x)&=&-\alpha h(t,x) + D\bigtriangleup h(t,x)
+\frac{\beta}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{N} g(X_{i}(t),x),\quad h(0,\cdot) =
h(\cdot).\label{main} \end{eqnarray} where $X_{i}(t)$ is the location of the
$i$th particle at time $t$ and $h(t,x)$ is the function measuring the
concentration of the medium at location $x$ with $h(0,x) = h(x)$. In this
article we describe a general discrete time non-linear formulation of the
aforementioned model and a strongly coupled particle system approximating it.
Similar models have been studied before (Budhiraja et al.(2011)) under a
restrictive compactness assumption on the domain of particles. In current work
the particles take values in $\R^{d}$ and consequently the stability analysis
is particularly challenging. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence
of a unique fixed point for the dynamical system governing the large $N$
asymptotics of the particle empirical measure. We also provide uniform in time
convergence rates for the particle empirical measure to the corresponding limit
measure under suitable conditions on the model.

989,Adversarial Examples: Opportunities and Challenges,"  With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence(AI), deep neural
networks (DNNs) have shown huge superiority over human in image recognition,
speech processing, autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis. However, recent
studies indicate that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs) which
are designed by attackers to fool deep learning models. Different from real
examples, AEs can hardly be distinguished from human eyes, but mislead the
model to predict incorrect outputs and therefore threaten security critical
deep-learning applications. In recent years, the generation and defense of AEs
have become a research hotspot in the field of AI security. This article
reviews the latest research progress of AEs. First, we introduce the concept,
cause, characteristic and evaluation metrics of AEs, then give a survey on the
state-of-the-art AE generation methods with the discussion of advantages and
disadvantages. After that we review the existing defenses and discuss their
limitations. Finally, the future research opportunities and challenges of AEs
are prospected.

990,Schur P-positivity and involution Stanley symmetric functions,"  The involution Stanley symmetric functions $\hat{F}_y$ are the stable limits
of the analogues of Schubert polynomials for the orbits of the orthogonal group
in the flag variety. These symmetric functions are also generating functions
for involution words, and are indexed by the involutions in the symmetric
group. By construction each $\hat{F}_y$ is a sum of Stanley symmetric functions
and therefore Schur positive. We prove the stronger fact that these power
series are Schur $P$-positive. We give an algorithm to efficiently compute the
decomposition of $\hat{F}_y$ into Schur $P$-summands, and prove that this
decomposition is triangular with respect to the dominance order on partitions.
As an application, we derive pattern avoidance conditions which characterize
the involution Stanley symmetric functions which are equal to Schur
$P$-functions. We deduce as a corollary that the involution Stanley symmetric
function of the reverse permutation is a Schur $P$-function indexed by a
shifted staircase shape. These results lead to alternate proofs of theorems of
Ardila-Serrano and DeWitt on skew Schur functions which are Schur
$P$-functions. We also prove new Pfaffian formulas for certain related
involution Schubert polynomials.

991,Model-based Clustering with Sparse Covariance Matrices,"  Finite Gaussian mixture models are widely used for model-based clustering of
continuous data. Nevertheless, since the number of model parameters scales
quadratically with the number of variables, these models can be easily
over-parameterized. For this reason, parsimonious models have been developed
via covariance matrix decompositions or assuming local independence. However,
these remedies do not allow for direct estimation of sparse covariance matrices
nor do they take into account that the structure of association among the
variables can vary from one cluster to the other. To this end, we introduce
mixtures of Gaussian covariance graph models for model-based clustering with
sparse covariance matrices. A penalized likelihood approach is employed for
estimation and a general penalty term on the graph configurations can be used
to induce different levels of sparsity and incorporate prior knowledge. Model
estimation is carried out using a structural-EM algorithm for parameters and
graph structure estimation, where two alternative strategies based on a genetic
algorithm and an efficient stepwise search are proposed for inference. With
this approach, sparse component covariance matrices are directly obtained. The
framework results in a parsimonious model-based clustering of the data via a
flexible model for the within-group joint distribution of the variables.
Extensive simulated data experiments and application to illustrative datasets
show that the method attains good classification performance and model quality.

993,Solving constraint-satisfaction problems with distributed neocortical-like neuronal networks,"  Finding actions that satisfy the constraints imposed by both external inputs
and internal representations is central to decision making. We demonstrate that
some important classes of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can be solved
by networks composed of homogeneous cooperative-competitive modules that have
connectivity similar to motifs observed in the superficial layers of neocortex.
The winner-take-all modules are sparsely coupled by programming neurons that
embed the constraints onto the otherwise homogeneous modular computational
substrate. We show rules that embed any instance of the CSPs planar four-color
graph coloring, maximum independent set, and Sudoku on this substrate, and
provide mathematical proofs that guarantee these graph coloring problems will
convergence to a solution. The network is composed of non-saturating linear
threshold neurons. Their lack of right saturation allows the overall network to
explore the problem space driven through the unstable dynamics generated by
recurrent excitation. The direction of exploration is steered by the constraint
neurons. While many problems can be solved using only linear inhibitory
constraints, network performance on hard problems benefits significantly when
these negative constraints are implemented by non-linear multiplicative
inhibition. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of instability
rather than stability in network computation, and also offer insight into the
computational role of dual inhibitory mechanisms in neural circuits.

994,Estimation of Relationship between Stimulation Current and Force Exerted during Isometric Contraction,"  In this study, we developed a method to estimate the relationship between
stimulation current and volatility during isometric contraction. In functional
electrical stimulation (FES), joints are driven by applying voltage to muscles.
This technology has been used for a long time in the field of rehabilitation,
and recently application oriented research has been reported. However,
estimation of the relationship between stimulus value and exercise capacity has
not been discussed to a great extent. Therefore, in this study, a human muscle
model was estimated using the transfer function estimation method with fast
Fourier transform. It was found that the relationship between stimulation
current and force exerted could be expressed by a first-order lag system. In
verification of the force estimate, the ability of the proposed model to
estimate the exerted force under steady state response was found to be good.

995,Training deep learning based denoisers without ground truth data,"  Recent deep learning based denoisers often outperform state-of-the-art
conventional denoisers such as BM3D. They are typically trained to minimize the
mean squared error (MSE) between the output of a deep neural network and the
ground truth image. In deep learning based denoisers, it is important to use
high quality noiseless ground truth for high performance, but it is often
challenging or even infeasible to obtain such a clean image in application
areas such as hyperspectral remote sensing and medical imaging. We propose a
Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) based method for training deep neural
network denoisers only with noisy images. We demonstrated that our SURE based
method without ground truth was able to train deep neural network denoisers to
yield performance close to deep learning denoisers trained with ground truth
and to outperform state-of-the-art BM3D. Further improvements were achieved by
including noisy test images for training denoiser networks using our proposed
SURE based method.

combinatorial optimization problems is costly, so we want to automatically
learn them instead. We show the feasibility of this approach on the important
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). We learn a heuristic algorithm that uses a
Neural Network policy to construct a tour. As an alternative to the Pointer
Network, our model is based entirely on (graph) attention layers and is
invariant to the input order of the nodes. We train the model efficiently using
REINFORCE with a simple and robust baseline based on a deterministic (greedy)
rollout of the best policy so far. We significantly improve over results from
previous works that consider learned heuristics for the TSP, reducing the
optimality gap for a single tour construction from 1.51% to 0.32% for instances
with 20 nodes, from 4.59% to 1.71% for 50 nodes and from 6.89% to 4.43% for 100
nodes. Additionally, we improve over a recent Reinforcement Learning framework

998,Low-Precision Floating-Point Schemes for Neural Network Training,"  The use of low-precision fixed-point arithmetic along with stochastic
rounding has been proposed as a promising alternative to the commonly used
32-bit floating point arithmetic to enhance training neural networks training
in terms of performance and energy efficiency. In the first part of this paper,
the behaviour of the 12-bit fixed-point arithmetic when training a
convolutional neural network with the CIFAR-10 dataset is analysed, showing
that such arithmetic is not the most appropriate for the training phase. After
that, the paper presents and evaluates, under the same conditions, alternative
low-precision arithmetics, starting with the 12-bit floating-point arithmetic.
These two representations are then leveraged using local scaling in order to
increase accuracy and get closer to the baseline 32-bit floating-point
arithmetic. Finally, the paper introduces a simplified model in which both the
outputs and the gradients of the neural networks are constrained to
power-of-two values, just using 7 bits for their representation. The evaluation
demonstrates a minimal loss in accuracy for the proposed Power-of-Two neural
network, avoiding the use of multiplications and divisions and thereby,
significantly reducing the training time as well as the energy consumption and
memory requirements during the training and inference phases.

meaningful is not only good scientific practice, it is a natural way to control
the Type I error rate. Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value - a
second-generation p-value - that formally accounts for scientific relevance and
leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a
pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect
sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The
second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that
are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the
data are compatible with null hypotheses, or with alternative hypotheses, or
when the data are inconclusive. Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a
proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false
discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where
traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation
p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results
by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful
and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are
compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.

temporally abstract actions, in the framework of options. We present a Robust
Options Policy Iteration (ROPI) algorithm with convergence guarantees, which
learns options that are robust to model uncertainty. We utilize ROPI to learn
robust options with the Robust Options Deep Q Network (RO-DQN) that solves
multiple tasks and mitigates model misspecification due to model uncertainty.
We present experimental results which suggest that policy iteration with linear
features may have an inherent form of robustness when using coarse feature
representations. In addition, we present experimental results which demonstrate
that robustness helps policy iteration implemented on top of deep neural
networks to generalize over a much broader range of dynamics than non-robust

1012,A Deep Active Survival Analysis Approach for Precision Treatment Recommendations: Application of Prostate Cancer,"  Survival analysis has been developed and applied in the number of areas
including manufacturing, finance, economics and healthcare. In healthcare
domain, usually clinical data are high-dimensional, sparse and complex and
sometimes there exists few amount of time-to-event (labeled) instances.
Therefore building an accurate survival model from electronic health records is
challenging. With this motivation, we address this issue and provide a new
survival analysis framework using deep learning and active learning with a
novel sampling strategy. First, our approach provides better representation
with lower dimensions from clinical features using labeled (time-to-event) and
unlabeled (censored) instances and then actively trains the survival model by
labeling the censored data using an oracle. As a clinical assistive tool, we
introduce a simple effective treatment recommendation approach based on our
survival model. In the experimental study, we apply our approach on
SEER-Medicare data related to prostate cancer among African-Americans and white
patients. The results indicate that our approach outperforms significantly than

1013,A powerful approach to the study of moderate effect modification in observational studies,"  Effect modification means the magnitude or stability of a treatment effect
varies as a function of an observed covariate. Generally, larger and more
stable treatment effects are insensitive to larger biases from unmeasured
covariates, so a causal conclusion may be considerably firmer if this pattern
is noted if it occurs. We propose a new strategy, called the submax-method,
that combines exploratory and confirmatory efforts to determine whether there
is stronger evidence of causality - that is, greater insensitivity to
unmeasured confounding - in some subgroups of individuals. It uses the joint
distribution of test statistics that split the data in various ways based on
certain observed covariates. For $L$ binary covariates, the method splits the
population $L$ times into two subpopulations, perhaps first men and women,
perhaps then smokers and nonsmokers, computing a test statistic from each
subpopulation, and appends the test statistic for the whole population, making
$2L+1$ test statistics in total. Although $L$ binary covariates define $2^{L}$
interaction groups, only $2L+1$ tests are performed, and at least $L+1$ of
these tests use at least half of the data. The submax-method achieves the
highest design sensitivity and the highest Bahadur efficiency of its component
tests. Moreover, the form of the test is sufficiently tractable that its large
sample power may be studied analytically. The simulation suggests that the
submax method exhibits superior performance, in comparison with an approach
using CART, when there is effect modification of moderate size. Using data from
the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Survey, an observational study of the
effects of physical activity on survival is used to illustrate the method. The
method is implemented in the $\texttt{R}$ package $\texttt{submax}$ which
contains the NHANES example.

1014,Exact Inference of Causal Relations in Dynamical Systems,"  From philosophers of ancient times to modern economists, biologists and other

problem is inferring the type of the causal relationship: whether it is uni- or

technology provides us tools to record data from complex systems such as the
ecosystem of our planet or the human brain, but understanding their functioning
needs detection and distinction of causal relationships of the system
components without interventions. Here we present a new method, which
distinguishes and assigns probabilities to the presence of all the possible
causal relations between two or more time series from dynamical systems. The
new method is validated on synthetic datasets and applied to EEG
(electroencephalographic) data recorded in epileptic patients. Given the

method selects models with the highest posterior probability using Factorized
Information Criteria (FIC), which is widely utilised in model selection for
probabilistic models with hidden variables. Our simulations indicated this

covariance matrix, for sparse graphs under different conditions. We have also
derived a closed-form solution that is optimal when the thresholded sample
covariance matrix has an acyclic structure. As a major generalization of the
previous result, in this paper we derive a closed-form solution for the GL for
graphs with chordal structures. We show that the GL and thresholding
equivalence conditions can significantly be simplified and are expected to hold
for high-dimensional problems if the thresholded sample covariance matrix has a
chordal structure. We then show that the GL and thresholding equivalence is
enough to reduce the GL to a maximum determinant matrix completion problem and
drive a recursive closed-form solution for the GL when the thresholded sample
covariance matrix has a chordal structure. For large-scale problems with up to
450 million variables, the proposed method can solve the GL problem in less
than 2 minutes, while the state-of-the-art methods converge in more than 2
hours.

1019,Sparse Deep Neural Network Exact Solutions,"  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as key enablers of machine learning.
Applying larger DNNs to more diverse applications is an important challenge.
The computations performed during DNN training and inference are dominated by
operations on the weight matrices describing the DNN. As DNNs incorporate more
layers and more neurons per layers, these weight matrices may be required to be
sparse because of memory limitations. Sparse DNNs are one possible approach,
but the underlying theory is in the early stages of development and presents a
number of challenges, including determining the accuracy of inference and
selecting nonzero weights for training. Associative array algebra has been
developed by the big data community to combine and extend database, matrix, and
graph/network concepts for use in large, sparse data problems. Applying this
mathematics to DNNs simplifies the formulation of DNN mathematics and reveals
that DNNs are linear over oscillating semirings. This work uses associative
array DNNs to construct exact solutions and corresponding perturbation models
to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) DNN equations that can be used to construct
test vectors for sparse DNN implementations over various precisions. These
solutions can be used for DNN verification, theoretical explorations of DNN
properties, and a starting point for the challenge of sparse training.

trading of financial instrument. The algorithm adopts a semantic sentiment
analysis technique to inspect the Twitter posts and to use them to predict the
behaviour of the stock market. Indeed, the algorithm is specifically developed
to take advantage of both the sentiment and the past values of a certain
financial instrument in order to choose the best investment decision. This
allows the algorithm to ensure the maximization of the obtainable profits by
trading on the stock market. We have conducted an investment simulation and
compared the performance of our proposed with a well-known benchmark (DJTATO
index) and the optimal results, in which an investor knows in advance the
future price of a product. The result shows that our approach outperforms the
benchmark and achieves the performance score close to the optimal result.

1021,Identification of Conduit Countries and Community Structures in the Withholding Tax Networks,"  Due to economic globalization, each country's economic law, including tax
laws and tax treaties, has been forced to work as a single network. However,
each jurisdiction (country or region) has not made its economic law under the
assumption that its law functions as an element of one network, so it has
brought unexpected results. We thought that the results are exactly
international tax avoidance. To contribute to the solution of international tax
avoidance, we tried to investigate which part of the network is vulnerable.
Specifically, focusing on treaty shopping, which is one of international tax
avoidance methods, we attempt to identified which jurisdiction are likely to be
used for treaty shopping from tax liabilities and the relationship between
jurisdictions which are likely to be used for treaty shopping and others. For
that purpose, based on withholding tax rates imposed on dividends, interest,
and royalties by jurisdictions, we produced weighted multiple directed graphs,
computed the centralities and detected the communities. As a result, we
clarified the jurisdictions that are likely to be used for treaty shopping and
pointed out that there are community structures. The results of this study
suggested that fewer jurisdictions need to introduce more regulations for
prevention of treaty abuse worldwide.

1022,On constraining projections of future climate using observations and simulations from multiple climate models,"  A new Bayesian framework is presented that can constrain projections of
future climate using historical observations by exploiting robust estimates of
emergent relationships between multiple climate models. We argue that emergent
relationships can be interpreted as constraints on model inadequacy, but that
projections may be biased if we do not account for internal variability in
climate model projections. We extend the previously proposed coexchangeable
framework to account for natural variability in the Earth system and internal
variability simulated by climate models. A detailed theoretical comparison with
previous multi-model projection frameworks is provided.
The proposed framework is applied to projecting surface temperature in the
Arctic at the end of the 21st century. A subset of available climate models are
selected in order to satisfy the assumptions of the framework. All available
initial condition runs from each model are utilized in order maximize the
utility of the data. Projected temperatures in some regions are more than 2C
lower when constrained by historical observations. The uncertainty about the
climate response is reduced by up to 30% where strong constraints exist.

1023,Higher order molecular organisation as a source of biological function,"  Molecular interactions have widely been modelled as networks. The local
wiring patterns around molecules in molecular networks are linked with their
biological functions. However, networks model only pairwise interactions
between molecules and cannot explicitly and directly capture the higher order
molecular organisation, such as protein complexes and pathways. Hence, we ask
if hypergraphs (hypernetworks), that directly capture entire complexes and
pathways along with protein-protein interactions (PPIs), carry additional
functional information beyond what can be uncovered from networks of pairwise
molecular interactions. The mathematical formalism of a hypergraph has long
been known, but not often used in studying molecular networks due to the lack
of sophisticated algorithms for mining the underlying biological information
hidden in the wiring patterns of molecular systems modelled as hypernetworks.
We propose a new, multi-scale, protein interaction hypernetwork model that
utilizes hypergraphs to capture different scales of protein organization,
including PPIs, protein complexes and pathways. In analogy to graphlets, we
introduce hypergraphlets, small, connected, non-isomorphic, induced
sub-hypergraphs of a hypergraph, to quantify the local wiring patterns of these
multi-scale molecular hypergraphs and to mine them for new biological
information. We apply them to model the multi-scale protein networks of baker
yeast and human and show that the higher order molecular organisation captured
by these hypergraphs is strongly related to the underlying biology.
Importantly, we demonstrate that our new models and data mining tools reveal
different, but complementary biological information compared to classical PPI
networks. We apply our hypergraphlets to successfully predict biological
functions of uncharacterised proteins.

1025,TIDBD: Adapting Temporal-difference Step-sizes Through Stochastic Meta-descent,"  In this paper, we introduce a method for adapting the step-sizes of temporal
difference (TD) learning. The performance of TD methods often depends on well
chosen step-sizes, yet few algorithms have been developed for setting the
step-size automatically for TD learning. An important limitation of current
methods is that they adapt a single step-size shared by all the weights of the
learning system. A vector step-size enables greater optimization by specifying
parameters on a per-feature basis. Furthermore, adapting parameters at
different rates has the added benefit of being a simple form of representation
learning. We generalize Incremental Delta Bar Delta (IDBD)---a vectorized
adaptive step-size method for supervised learning---to TD learning, which we
name TIDBD. We demonstrate that TIDBD is able to find appropriate step-sizes in
both stationary and non-stationary prediction tasks, outperforming ordinary TD
methods and TD methods with scalar step-size adaptation; we demonstrate that it
can differentiate between features which are relevant and irrelevant for a
given task, performing representation learning; and we show on a real-world
robot prediction task that TIDBD is able to outperform ordinary TD methods and
TD methods augmented with AlphaBound and RMSprop.

1026,FRET-based nanocommunication with luciferase and channelrhodopsin molecules for in-body medical systems,"  The paper is concerned with an in-body system gathering data for medical
purposes. It is focused on communication between the following two components
of the system: liposomes gathering the data inside human veins and a detector
collecting the data from liposomes. Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
is considered as a mechanism for communication between the system components.
The usage of bioluminescent molecules as an energy source for generating FRET
signals is suggested and the performance evaluation of this approach is given.
FRET transmission may be initiated without an aid of an external laser, which
is crucial in case of communication taking place inside of human body. It is
also shown how to solve the problem of FRET signals recording. The usage of
channelrhodopsin molecules, able to receive FRET signals and convert them into
voltage, is proposed. The communication system is modelled with molecular
structures and spectral characteristics of the proposed molecules and further
validated by using Monte Carlo computer simulations, calculating the data
throughput and the bit error rate.

1027,International crop trade networks: The impact of shocks and cascades,"  Analyzing available FAO data from 176 countries over 21 years, we observe an
increase of complexity in the international trade of maize, rice, soy, and
wheat. A larger number of countries play a role as producers or intermediaries,
either for trade or food processing. In consequence, we find that the trade
networks become more prone to failure cascades caused by exogenous shocks. In
our model, countries compensate for demand deficits by imposing export
restrictions. To capture these, we construct higher-order trade dependency
networks for the different crops and years. These networks reveal hidden
dependencies between countries and allow to discuss policy implications.

The objective of this study was to specify the level of motor activity of
pregnant sows housed in groups in different housing systems. Eleven commercial
farms were selected for this study. Four housing systems were represented:
small groups of five to seven sows (SG), free access stalls (FS) with exercise
area, electronic sow feeder with a stable group (ESFsta) or a dynamic group
(ESFdyn). Ten sows in mid-gestation were observed in each farm. The
observations of motor activity were made for 6 hours at the first meal or at
the start of the feeding sequence, two consecutive days and at regular
intervals of 4 minutes. The results show that the motor activity of
group-housed sows depends on the housing system. The activity is higher with
the ESFdyn system (standing: 55.7%), sows are less active in the SG system
(standing: 26.5%), and FS system is intermediate. The distance traveled by sows
in ESF system is linked to a larger area available. Thus, sows travel an
average of 362 m $\pm$ 167 m in the ESFdyn system with an average available
surface of 446 m${}^2$ whereas sows in small groups travel 50 m $\pm$ 15 m for

1029,Predicting Oral Disintegrating Tablet Formulations by Neural Network Techniques,"  Oral Disintegrating Tablets (ODTs) is a novel dosage form that can be
dissolved on the tongue within 3min or less especially for geriatric and
pediatric patients. Current ODT formulation studies usually rely on the
personal experience of pharmaceutical experts and trial-and-error in the
laboratory, which is inefficient and time-consuming. The aim of current
research was to establish the prediction model of ODT formulations with direct
compression process by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network
(DNN) techniques. 145 formulation data were extracted from Web of Science. All
data sets were divided into three parts: training set (105 data), validation
set (20) and testing set (20). ANN and DNN were compared for the prediction of
the disintegrating time. The accuracy of the ANN model has reached 85.60%,
80.00% and 75.00% on the training set, validation set and testing set
respectively, whereas that of the DNN model was 85.60%, 85.00% and 80.00%,
respectively. Compared with the ANN, DNN showed the better prediction for ODT
formulations. It is the first time that deep neural network with the improved
dataset selection algorithm is applied to formulation prediction on small data.
The proposed predictive approach could evaluate the critical parameters about
quality control of formulation, and guide research and process development. The
implementation of this prediction model could effectively reduce drug product
development timeline and material usage, and proactively facilitate the
development of a robust drug product.

1030,Probing for sparse and fast variable selection with model-based boosting,"  We present a new variable selection method based on model-based gradient
boosting and randomly permuted variables. Model-based boosting is a tool to fit
a statistical model while performing variable selection at the same time. A
drawback of the fitting lies in the need of multiple model fits on slightly
altered data (e.g. cross-validation or bootstrap) to find the optimal number of
boosting iterations and prevent overfitting. In our proposed approach, we
augment the data set with randomly permuted versions of the true variables, so
called shadow variables, and stop the step-wise fitting as soon as such a
variable would be added to the model. This allows variable selection in a
single fit of the model without requiring further parameter tuning. We show
that our probing approach can compete with state-of-the-art selection methods
like stability selection in a high-dimensional classification benchmark and
apply it on gene expression data for the estimation of riboflavin production of
Bacillus subtilis.

1031,Understanding Membership Inferences on Well-Generalized Learning Models,"  Membership Inference Attack (MIA) determines the presence of a record in a
machine learning model's training data by querying the model. Prior work has
shown that the attack is feasible when the model is overfitted to its training
data or when the adversary controls the training algorithm. However, when the
model is not overfitted and the adversary does not control the training
algorithm, the threat is not well understood. In this paper, we report a study
that discovers overfitting to be a sufficient but not a necessary condition for
an MIA to succeed. More specifically, we demonstrate that even a
well-generalized model contains vulnerable instances subject to a new
generalized MIA (GMIA). In GMIA, we use novel techniques for selecting
vulnerable instances and detecting their subtle influences ignored by
overfitting metrics. Specifically, we successfully identify individual records
with high precision in real-world datasets by querying black-box machine
learning models. Further we show that a vulnerable record can even be
indirectly attacked by querying other related records and existing
generalization techniques are found to be less effective in protecting the
vulnerable instances. Our findings sharpen the understanding of the fundamental
cause of the problem: the unique influences the training instance may have on
the model.

sequence prediction problems, i.e. generating nice-looking input samples given

introduce three models based on Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) for
unsupervised sequence learning and prediction. Experimental results for these

data, videos of low-resolution bouncing balls, and motion capture data. The
main contribution of this thesis is to provide evidence that GSNs are a viable
framework to learn useful representations of complex sequential input data, and
to suggest a new framework for deep generative models to learn complex
sequences by decoupling static input representations from dynamic time

1034,Towards more Reliable Transfer Learning,"  Multi-source transfer learning has been proven effective when within-target
labeled data is scarce. Previous work focuses primarily on exploiting domain
similarities and assumes that source domains are richly or at least comparably
labeled. While this strong assumption is never true in practice, this paper
relaxes it and addresses challenges related to sources with diverse labeling
volume and diverse reliability. The first challenge is combining domain
similarity and source reliability by proposing a new transfer learning method
that utilizes both source-target similarities and inter-source relationships.
The second challenge involves pool-based active learning where the oracle is
only available in source domains, resulting in an integrated active transfer
learning framework that incorporates distribution matching and uncertainty
sampling. Extensive experiments on synthetic and two real-world datasets
clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods over several
baselines including state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.

samples from given target distributions for probabilistic inference. Our method
is based on iteratively adjusting the neural network parameters so that the
output changes along a Stein variational gradient direction (Liu & Wang, 2016)
that maximally decreases the KL divergence with the target distribution. Our
method works for any target distribution specified by their unnormalized
density function, and can train any black-box architectures that are
differentiable in terms of the parameters we want to adapt. We demonstrate our
method with a number of applications, including variational autoencoder (VAE)
with expressive encoders to model complex latent space structures, and
hyper-parameter learning of MCMC samplers that allows Bayesian inference to
adaptively improve itself when seeing more data.

allocating sensing resources adaptively, one can effectively eliminate null
locations and localize signals with a smaller study budget. We formulate a
decision-theoretic framework for simultaneous multi- stage adaptive testing and
study how to minimize the total number of measurements while meeting
pre-specified constraints on both the false positive rate (FPR) and missed
discovery rate (MDR). The new procedure, which effectively pools information
across individual tests using a simultaneous multistage adaptive ranking and
thresholding (SMART) approach, can achieve precise error rates control and lead
to great savings in total study costs. Numerical studies confirm the
effectiveness of SMART for FPR and MDR control and show that it achieves
substantial power gain over existing methods. The SMART procedure is
demonstrated through the analysis of high-throughput screening data and spatial
imaging data.

1037,Switching Isotropic and Directional Exploration with Parameter Space Noise in Deep Reinforcement Learning,"  This paper proposes an exploration method for deep reinforcement learning
based on parameter space noise. Recent studies have experimentally shown that
parameter space noise results in better exploration than the commonly used
action space noise. Previous methods devised a way to update the diagonal
covariance matrix of a noise distribution and did not consider the direction of
the noise vector and its correlation. In addition, fast updates of the noise
distribution are required to facilitate policy learning. We propose a method
that deforms the noise distribution according to the accumulated returns and
the noises that have led to the returns. Moreover, this method switches
isotropic exploration and directional exploration in parameter space with
regard to obtained rewards. We validate our exploration strategy in the OpenAI
Gym continuous environments and modified environments with sparse rewards. The
proposed method achieves results that are competitive with a previous method at
baseline tasks. Moreover, our approach exhibits better performance in sparse
reward environments by exploration with the switching strategy.

an easy-to-use conjugate prior for the shape parameter of a gamma. This
inconvenience is usually dealt with by using either Metropolis-Hastings moves,
rejection sampling methods, or numerical integration. However, in models with a
large number of shape parameters, these existing methods are slower or more
complicated than one would like, making them burdensome in practice. It turns
out that the full conditional distribution of the gamma shape parameter is well
approximated by a gamma distribution, even for small sample sizes, when the
prior on the shape parameter is also a gamma distribution. This article
introduces a quick and easy algorithm for finding a gamma distribution that
approximates the full conditional distribution of the shape parameter. We
empirically demonstrate the speed and accuracy of the approximation across a
wide range of conditions. If exactness is required, the approximation can be
used as a proposal distribution for Metropolis-Hastings.

biologists due to their ability to capture complex non-treelike evolutionary
processes. From a combinatorial point of view, such networks are certain types
of rooted directed acyclic graphs whose leaves are labelled by, for example,
species. A number of mathematically interesting classes of phylogenetic
networks are known. These include the biologically relevant class of stable
phylogenetic networks whose members are defined via certain fold-up and un-fold
operations that link them with concepts arising within the theory of, for
example, graph fibrations. Despite this exciting link, the structural
complexity of stable phylogenetic networks is still relatively poorly
understood. Employing the popular tree-based, reticulation-visible, and
tree-child properties which allow one to gauge this complexity in one way or
another, we provide novel characterizations for when a stable phylogenetic
network satisfies either one of these three properties.

1040,The Structure Transfer Machine Theory and Applications,"  Representation learning is a fundamental but challenging problem, especially
when the distribution of data is unknown. We propose a new representation
learning method, termed Structure Transfer Machine (STM), which enables feature
learning process to converge at the representation expectation in a
probabilistic way. We theoretically show that such an expected value of the
representation (mean) is achievable if the manifold structure can be
transferred from the data space to the feature space. The resulting structure
regularization term, named manifold loss, is incorporated into the loss
function of the typical deep learning pipeline. The STM architecture is
constructed to enforce the learned deep representation to satisfy the intrinsic
manifold structure from the data, which results in robust features that suit
various application scenarios, such as digit recognition, image classification
and object tracking. Compared to state-of-the-art CNN architectures, we achieve
the better results on several commonly used benchmarks\footnote{The source code

1041,A Lattice Model of Charge-Pattern-Dependent Polyampholyte Phase Separation,"  In view of recent intense experimental and theoretical interests in the
biophysics of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs), heteropolymer models with chain molecules configured as
self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice are constructed to study how
phase behaviors depend on the sequence of monomers along the chains. To address
pertinent general principles, we focus primarily on two fully charged
50-monomer sequences with significantly different charge patterns. Each monomer
in our models occupies a single lattice site and all monomers interact via a
screened pairwise Coulomb potential. Phase diagrams are obtained by extensive
Monte Carlo sampling performed at multiple temperatures on ensembles of 300
chains in boxes of sizes ranging from $52\times 52\times 52$ to $246\times
246\times 246$ to simulate a large number of different systems with the overall
polymer volume fraction $\phi$ in each system varying from $0.001$ to $0.1$.
Phase separation in the model systems is characterized by the emergence of a
large cluster connected by inter-monomer nearest-neighbor lattice contacts and
by large fluctuations in local polymer density. The simulated critical
temperatures, $T_{\rm cr}$, of phase separation for the two sequences differ
significantly, whereby the sequence with a more ""blocky"" charge pattern
exhibits a substantially higher propensity to phase separate. The trend is
consistent with our sequence-specific random-phase-approximation (RPA) polymer
theory, but the variation of the simulated $T_{\rm cr}$ with a previously
proposed ""sequence charge decoration"" pattern parameter is milder than that
predicted by RPA. Ramifications of our findings for the development of
analytical theory and simulation protocols of IDP LLPS are discussed.

1042,Semi-Supervised Approaches to Efficient Evaluation of Model Prediction Performance,"  In many modern machine learning applications, the outcome is expensive or
time-consuming to collect while the predictor information is easy to obtain.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims at utilizing large amounts of `unlabeled'
data along with small amounts of `labeled' data to improve the efficiency of a
classical supervised approach. Though numerous SSL classification and
prediction procedures have been proposed in recent years, no methods currently
exist to evaluate the prediction performance of a working regression model. In
the context of developing phenotyping algorithms derived from electronic
medical records (EMR), we present an efficient two-step estimation procedure
for evaluating a binary classifier based on various prediction performance
measures in the semi-supervised (SS) setting. In step I, the labeled data is
used to obtain a non-parametrically calibrated estimate of the conditional risk
function. In step II, SS estimates of the prediction accuracy parameters are
constructed based on the estimated conditional risk function and the unlabeled
data. We demonstrate that under mild regularity conditions the proposed
estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Importantly, the
asymptotic variance of the SS estimators is always smaller than that of the
supervised counterparts under correct model specification. We also correct for
potential overfitting bias in the SS estimators in finite sample with
cross-validation and develop a perturbation resampling procedure to approximate
their distributions. Our proposals are evaluated through extensive simulation
studies and illustrated with two real EMR studies aiming to develop phenotyping
algorithms for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

1043,Exponential Ergodicity of the Bouncy Particle Sampler,"  Non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes based on piecewise
deterministic Markov processes have been recently introduced in applied
probability, automatic control, physics and statistics. Although these
algorithms demonstrate experimentally good performance and are accordingly
increasingly used in a wide range of applications, geometric ergodicity results
for such schemes have only been established so far under very restrictive
assumptions. We give here verifiable conditions on the target distribution
under which the Bouncy Particle Sampler algorithm introduced in \cite{P_dW_12}
is geometrically ergodic. This holds whenever the target satisfies a curvature
condition and has tails decaying at least as fast as an exponential and at most
as fast as a Gaussian distribution. This allows us to provide a central limit
theorem for the associated ergodic averages. When the target has tails thinner
than a Gaussian distribution, we propose an original modification of this
scheme that is geometrically ergodic. For thick-tailed target distributions,
such as $t$-distributions, we extend the idea pioneered in \cite{J_G_12} in a
random walk Metropolis context. We apply a change of variable to obtain a
transformed target satisfying the tail conditions for geometric ergodicity. By
sampling the transformed target using the Bouncy Particle Sampler and mapping
back the Markov process to the original parameterization, we obtain a
geometrically ergodic algorithm.

1044,Spatially Transformed Adversarial Examples,"  Recent studies show that widely used deep neural networks (DNNs) are
vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial examples. Many advanced algorithms
have been proposed to generate adversarial examples by leveraging the
$\mathcal{L}_p$ distance for penalizing perturbations. Researchers have
explored different defense methods to defend against such adversarial attacks.
While the effectiveness of $\mathcal{L}_p$ distance as a metric of perceptual
quality remains an active research area, in this paper we will instead focus on
a different type of perturbation, namely spatial transformation, as opposed to
manipulating the pixel values directly as in prior works. Perturbations
generated through spatial transformation could result in large $\mathcal{L}_p$
distance measures, but our extensive experiments show that such spatially
transformed adversarial examples are perceptually realistic and more difficult
to defend against with existing defense systems. This potentially provides a
new direction in adversarial example generation and the design of corresponding
defenses. We visualize the spatial transformation based perturbation for
different examples and show that our technique can produce realistic
adversarial examples with smooth image deformation. Finally, we visualize the
attention of deep networks with different types of adversarial examples to
better understand how these examples are interpreted.

eukaryotic models. The secretory pathway was the first trafficking pathway
clearly understood mainly thanks to the work done in the laboratory of Randy
Schekman in the 1980s. They have isolated yeast sec mutants unable to secrete
an extracellular enzyme and these SEC genes were identified as encoding key
effectors of the secretory machinery. For this work, the 2013 Nobel Prize in
Physiology and Medicine has been awarded to Randy Schekman; the prize is shared
with James Rothman and Thomas S{ÃƒÂ¼}dhof. Here, we present the different
trafficking pathways of yeast S. cerevisiae. At the Golgi apparatus newly
synthesized proteins are sorted between those transported to the plasma
membrane (PM), or the external medium, via the exocytosis or secretory pathway
(SEC), and those targeted to the vacuole either through endosomes (vacuolar
protein sorting or VPS pathway) or directly (alkaline phosphatase or ALP
pathway). Plasma membrane proteins can be internalized by endocytosis (END) and
transported to endosomes where they are sorted between those targeted for
vacuolar degradation and those redirected to the Golgi (recycling or RCY
pathway). Studies in yeast S. cerevisiae allowed the identification of most of
the known effectors, protein complexes, and trafficking pathways in eukaryotic
cells, and most of them are conserved among eukaryotes.

combine deep learning and renderers are limited by hand-crafted likelihood or
distance functions, a need for large amounts of supervision, or difficulties in
scaling their inference algorithms to richer datasets. To mitigate these
issues, we present SPIRAL, an adversarially trained agent that generates a
program which is executed by a graphics engine to interpret and sample images.
The goal of this agent is to fool a discriminator network that distinguishes
between real and rendered data, trained with a distributed reinforcement
learning setup without any supervision. A surprising finding is that using the
discriminator's output as a reward signal is the key to allow the agent to make
meaningful progress at matching the desired output rendering. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an end-to-end, unsupervised
and adversarial inverse graphics agent on challenging real world (MNIST,
Omniglot, CelebA) and synthetic 3D datasets.

1048,Smoothing with Couplings of Conditional Particle Filters,"  In state space models, smoothing refers to the task of estimating a latent
stochastic process given noisy measurements related to the process. We propose
an unbiased estimator of smoothing expectations. The lack-of-bias property has
methodological benefits: independent estimators can be generated in parallel,
and confidence intervals can be constructed from the central limit theorem to
quantify the approximation error. To design unbiased estimators, we combine a
generic debiasing technique for Markov chains with a Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm for smoothing. The resulting procedure is widely applicable and we
show in numerical experiments that the removal of the bias comes at a
manageable increase in variance. We establish the validity of the proposed
estimators under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments are provided on toy
models, including a setting of highly-informative observations, and a realistic
Lotka-Volterra model with an intractable transition density.

1049,COPA: Constrained PARAFAC2 for Sparse & Large Datasets,"  PARAFAC2 has demonstrated success in modeling irregular tensors, where the
tensor dimensions vary across one of the modes. An example scenario is modeling
treatments across a set of patients with the varying number of medical
encounters over time. Despite recent improvements on unconstrained PARAFAC2,
its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise which limits their
interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable
approach is required to support those constraints efficiently for large
datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a {\it CO}nstrained {\it
PA}RAFAC2 (COPA) method, which carefully incorporates optimization constraints
such as temporal smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the resulting
factors. To efficiently support all those constraints, COPA adopts a hybrid
optimization framework using alternating optimization and alternating direction
method of multiplier (AO-ADMM). As evaluated on large electronic health record
(EHR) datasets with hundreds of thousands of patients, COPA achieves
significant speedups (up to 36 times faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches
that only attempt to handle a subset of the constraints that COPA enables.
Overall, our method outperforms all the baselines attempting to handle a subset
of the constraints in terms of speed, while achieving the same level of
accuracy. Through a case study on temporal phenotyping of medically complex
children, we demonstrate how the constraints imposed by COPA reveal concise
phenotypes and meaningful temporal profiles of patients. The clinical
interpretation of both the phenotypes and the temporal profiles was confirmed
by a medical expert.

1050,Missing Data as Part of the Social Behavior in Real-World Financial Complex Systems,"  Many real-world networks are known to exhibit facts that counter our
knowledge prescribed by the theories on network creation and communication
patterns. A common prerequisite in network analysis is that information on
nodes and links will be complete because network topologies are extremely
sensitive to missing information of this kind. Therefore, many real-world
networks that fail to meet this criterion under random sampling may be
discarded.
In this paper we offer a framework for interpreting the missing observations
in network data under the hypothesis that these observations are not missing at
random. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study of a financial trade
network, where the awareness of agents to the data collection procedure by a
self-interested observer may result in strategic revealing or withholding of
information. The non-random missingness has been overlooked despite the
possibility of this being an important feature of the processes by which the
network is generated. The analysis demonstrates that strategic information
withholding may be a valid general phenomenon in complex systems. The evidence
is sufficient to support the existence of an influential observer and to offer
a compelling dynamic mechanism for the creation of the network.

1051,Quantum Structures in Human Decision-making: Towards Quantum Expected Utility,"  {\it Ellsberg thought experiments} and empirical confirmation of Ellsberg
preferences pose serious challenges to {\it subjective expected utility theory}
(SEUT). We have recently elaborated a quantum-theoretic framework for human
decisions under uncertainty which satisfactorily copes with the Ellsberg
paradox and other puzzles of SEUT. We apply here the quantum-theoretic
framework to the {\it Ellsberg two-urn example}, showing that the paradox can
be explained by assuming a state change of the conceptual entity that is the
object of the decision ({\it decision-making}, or {\it DM}, {\it entity}) and
representing subjective probabilities by quantum probabilities. We also model
the empirical data we collected in a DM test on human participants within the
theoretic framework above. The obtained results are relevant, as they provide a
line to model real life, e.g., financial and medical, decisions that show the
same empirical patterns as the two-urn experiment.

1052,A Kernel Theory of Modern Data Augmentation,"  Data augmentation, a technique in which a training set is expanded with
class-preserving transformations, is ubiquitous in modern machine learning
pipelines. In this paper, we seek to establish a theoretical framework for
understanding modern data augmentation techniques. We start by showing that for
kernel classifiers, data augmentation can be approximated by first-order
feature averaging and second-order variance regularization components. We
connect this general approximation framework to prior work in invariant
kernels, tangent propagation, and robust optimization. Next, we explicitly
tackle the compositional aspect of modern data augmentation techniques,
proposing a novel model of data augmentation as a Markov process. Under this
model, we show that performing $k$-nearest neighbors with data augmentation is
asymptotically equivalent to a kernel classifier. Finally, we illustrate ways
in which our theoretical framework can be leveraged to accelerate machine
learning workflows in practice, including reducing the amount of computation
needed to train on augmented data, and predicting the utility of a
transformation prior to training.

1053,Efficient algorithms to discover alterations with complementary functional association in cancer,"  Recent large cancer studies have measured somatic alterations in an
unprecedented number of tumours. These large datasets allow the identification
of cancer-related sets of genetic alterations by identifying relevant
combinatorial patterns. Among such patterns, mutual exclusivity has been
employed by several recent methods that have shown its effectivenes in
characterizing gene sets associated to cancer. Mutual exclusivity arises
because of the complementarity, at the functional level, of alterations in
genes which are part of a group (e.g., a pathway) performing a given function.
The availability of quantitative target profiles, from genetic perturbations or
from clinical phenotypes, provides additional information that can be leveraged
to improve the identification of cancer related gene sets by discovering groups
with complementary functional associations with such targets.
In this work we study the problem of finding groups of mutually exclusive
alterations associated with a quantitative (functional) target. We propose a
combinatorial formulation for the problem, and prove that the associated
computation problem is computationally hard. We design two algorithms to solve
the problem and implement them in our tool UNCOVER. We provide analytic
evidence of the effectiveness of UNCOVER in finding high-quality solutions and
show experimentally that UNCOVER finds sets of alterations significantly
associated with functional targets in a variety of scenarios. In addition, our
algorithms are much faster than the state-of-the-art, allowing the analysis of
large datasets of thousands of target profiles from cancer cell lines. We show
that on one such dataset from project Achilles our methods identify several
significant gene sets with complementary functional associations with targets.

1054,Dimensionality Reduction for Stationary Time Series via Stochastic Nonconvex Optimization,"  Stochastic optimization naturally arises in machine learning. Efficient
algorithms with provable guarantees, however, are still largely missing, when
the objective function is nonconvex and the data points are dependent. This
paper studies this fundamental challenge through a streaming PCA problem for
stationary time series data. Specifically, our goal is to estimate the
principle component of time series data with respect to the covariance matrix
of the stationary distribution. Computationally, we propose a variant of Oja's
algorithm combined with downsampling to control the bias of the stochastic
gradient caused by the data dependency. Theoretically, we quantify the
uncertainty of our proposed stochastic algorithm based on diffusion
approximations. This allows us to prove the asymptotic rate of convergence and
further implies near optimal asymptotic sample complexity. Numerical
experiments are provided to support our analysis.

three-dimensional Brownian motion in the positive octant with absorption at the
boundaries. Separation of variables in spherical coordinates leads to an
eigenvalue problem for the resulting boundary value problem in the two angular
components. The main theoretical result is a solution to the original problem
expressed as an expansion into special functions and an eigenvalue which has to
be chosen to allow a matching of the boundary condition. We discuss and test
several computational methods to solve a finite-dimensional approximation to
this nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Finally, we apply our results to the
computation of default probabilities and credit valuation adjustments in a
structural credit model with mutual liabilities.

1056,The Wisdom of a Kalman Crowd,"  The Kalman Filter has been called one of the greatest inventions in
statistics during the 20th century. Its purpose is to measure the state of a
system by processing the noisy data received from different electronic sensors.
In comparison, a useful resource for managers in their effort to make the right
decisions is the wisdom of crowds. This phenomenon allows managers to combine
judgments by different employees to get estimates that are often more accurate
and reliable than estimates, which managers produce alone. Since harnessing the
collective intelligence of employees, and filtering signals from multiple noisy
sensors appear related, we looked at the possibility of using the Kalman Filter
on estimates by people. Our predictions suggest, and our findings based on the
Survey of Professional Forecasters reveal, that the Kalman Filter can help
managers solve their decision-making problems by giving them stronger signals
before they choose. Indeed, when used on a subset of forecasters identified by
the Contribution Weighted Model, the Kalman Filter beat that rule clearly,
across all the forecasting horizons in the survey.

1057,Bayesian Renewables Scenario Generation via Deep Generative Networks,"  We present a method to generate renewable scenarios using Bayesian
probabilities by implementing the Bayesian generative adversarial
network~(Bayesian GAN), which is a variant of generative adversarial networks
based on two interconnected deep neural networks. By using a Bayesian
formulation, generators can be constructed and trained to produce scenarios
that capture different salient modes in the data, allowing for better diversity
and more accurate representation of the underlying physical process. Compared
to conventional statistical models that are often hard to scale or sample from,
this method is model-free and can generate samples extremely efficiently. For
validation, we use wind and solar times-series data from NREL integration data
sets to train the Bayesian GAN. We demonstrate that proposed method is able to
generate clusters of wind scenarios with different variance and mean value, and
is able to distinguish and generate wind and solar scenarios simultaneously
even if the historical data are intentionally mixed.

bandwidth selection. Then, we introduce common approaches to the construction
of confidence intervals/bands, and we discuss how to handle bias. Next, we talk
about recent advances in the inference of geometric and topological features of

caused significant damage. Informed by hydrodynamic storm surge and wave
modeling and post-storm satellite imagery, a rapid damage survey was soon
conducted for 1600+ residential buildings in Big Pine Key and Marathon. Damage
categorizations and statistical analysis reveal distinct factors governing
damage at these two locations. The distance from the coast is significant for
the damage in Big Pine Key, as severely damaged buildings were located near
narrow waterways connected to the ocean. Building type and size are critical in
Marathon, highlighted by the near-complete destruction of trailer communities
there. These observations raise issues of affordability and equity that need
consideration in damage recovery and rebuilding for resilience.

1060,Status maximization as a source of fairness in a networked dictator game,"  Human behavioural patterns exhibit selfish or competitive, as well as
selfless or altruistic tendencies, both of which have demonstrable effects on
human social and economic activity. In behavioural economics, such effects have
traditionally been illustrated experimentally via simple games like the
dictator and ultimatum games. Experiments with these games suggest that, beyond
rational economic thinking, human decision-making processes are influenced by
social preferences, such as an inclination to fairness. In this study we
suggest that the apparent gap between competitive and altruistic human
tendencies can be bridged by assuming that people are primarily maximising
their status, i.e., a utility function different from simple profit
maximisation. To this end we analyse a simple agent-based model, where
individuals play the repeated dictator game in a social network they can
modify. As model parameters we consider the living costs and the rate at which
agents forget infractions by others. We find that individual strategies used in
the game vary greatly, from selfish to selfless, and that both of the above
parameters determine when individuals form complex and cohesive social
networks.

1061,Learning from a lot: Empirical Bayes in high-dimensional prediction settings,"  Empirical Bayes is a versatile approach to `learn from a lot' in two ways:
first, from a large number of variables and second, from a potentially large
amount of prior information, e.g. stored in public repositories. We review
applications of a variety of empirical Bayes methods to several well-known
model-based prediction methods including penalized regression, linear
discriminant analysis, and Bayesian models with sparse or dense priors. We
discuss `formal' empirical Bayes methods which maximize the marginal
likelihood, but also more informal approaches based on other data summaries. We
contrast empirical Bayes to cross-validation and full Bayes, and discuss hybrid
approaches. To study the relation between the quality of an empirical Bayes
estimator and $p$, the number of variables, we consider a simple empirical
Bayes estimator in a linear model setting.
We argue that empirical Bayes is particularly useful when the prior contains
multiple parameters which model a priori information on variables, termed
`co-data'. In particular, we present two novel examples that allow for co-data.
First, a Bayesian spike-and-slab setting that facilitates inclusion of multiple
co-data sources and types; second, a hybrid empirical Bayes-full Bayes ridge
regression approach for estimation of the posterior predictive interval.

1062,Dissipativity Theory for Accelerating Stochastic Variance Reduction: A Unified Analysis of SVRG and Katyusha Using Semidefinite Programs,"  Techniques for reducing the variance of gradient estimates used in stochastic
programming algorithms for convex finite-sum problems have received a great
deal of attention in recent years. By leveraging dissipativity theory from
control, we provide a new perspective on two important variance-reduction
algorithms: SVRG and its direct accelerated variant Katyusha. Our perspective
provides a physically intuitive understanding of the behavior of SVRG-like
methods via a principle of energy conservation. The tools discussed here allow
us to automate the convergence analysis of SVRG-like methods by capturing their
essential properties in small semidefinite programs amenable to standard
analysis and computational techniques. Our approach recovers existing
convergence results for SVRG and Katyusha and generalizes the theory to
alternative parameter choices. We also discuss how our approach complements the
linear coupling technique. Our combination of perspectives leads to a better
understanding of accelerated variance-reduced stochastic methods for finite-sum
problems.

that both of them accurately approximate the sampling distributions of motif
densities, i.e., of the normalized counts of the number of times fixed
subgraphs appear in the network. These densities characterize the distribution
of (infinite) exchangeable networks. Our bootstraps therefore give, for the
first time, a valid quantification of uncertainty in inferences about
fundamental network statistics, and so of parameters identifiable from them.

In this paper, we revisit several representative sample-based evaluation
metrics for GANs, and address the problem of how to evaluate the evaluation
metrics. We start with a few necessary conditions for metrics to produce
meaningful scores, such as distinguishing real from generated samples,
identifying mode dropping and mode collapsing, and detecting overfitting. With
a series of carefully designed experiments, we comprehensively investigate
existing sample-based metrics and identify their strengths and limitations in
practical settings. Based on these results, we observe that kernel Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) and the 1-Nearest-Neighbor (1-NN) two-sample test seem to
satisfy most of the desirable properties, provided that the distances between
samples are computed in a suitable feature space. Our experiments also unveil
interesting properties about the behavior of several popular GAN models, such
as whether they are memorizing training samples, and how far they are from
learning the target distribution.

1065,Ranking with Adaptive Neighbors,"  Retrieving the most similar objects in a large-scale database for a given
query is a fundamental building block in many application domains, ranging from
web searches, visual, cross media, and document retrievals. State-of-the-art
approaches have mainly focused on capturing the underlying geometry of the data
manifolds. Graph-based approaches, in particular, define various diffusion
processes on weighted data graphs. Despite success, these approaches rely on
fixed-weight graphs, making ranking sensitive to the input affinity matrix. In
this study, we propose a new ranking algorithm that simultaneously learns the
data affinity matrix and the ranking scores. The proposed optimization
formulation assigns adaptive neighbors to each point in the data based on the
local connectivity, and the smoothness constraint assigns similar ranking
scores to similar data points. We develop a novel and efficient algorithm to
solve the optimization problem. Evaluations using synthetic and real datasets
suggest that the proposed algorithm can outperform the existing methods.

article we address the problem of learning a distance metric for plain
radiographs that captures a notion of ""radiological similarity"": two chest
radiographs are considered to be similar if they share similar abnormalities.
Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNs) are used to learn a low-dimensional
embedding for the radiographs that is equipped with the desired metric. Two
loss functions are proposed to deal with multi-labelled images and potentially
noisy labels. We report on a large-scale study involving over 745,000 chest
radiographs whose labels were automatically extracted from free-text
radiological reports through a natural language processing system. Using 4,500
validated exams, we demonstrate that the methodology performs satisfactorily on
clustering and image retrieval tasks. Remarkably, the learned metric separates
normal exams from those having radiological abnormalities.

and unlabeled data (PU learning) and estimating the class-prior in unlabeled
data under the case-control scenario. Most of the recent methods of PU learning
require an estimate of the class-prior probability in unlabeled data, and it is
estimated in advance with another method. However, such a two-step approach
which first estimates the class prior and then trains a classifier may not be
the optimal approach since the estimation error of the class-prior is not taken
into account when a classifier is trained. In this paper, we propose a novel
unified approach to estimating the class-prior and training a classifier
alternately. Our proposed method is simple to implement and computationally
efficient. Through experiments, we demonstrate the practical usefulness of the
proposed method.

generating function, which can be obtained as solution of a convolution Riccati
equation. We further introduce the class of affine forward order flow intensity
(AFI) models, which are structurally similar to AFV models, but driven by jump
processes, and which include Hawkes-type models. We show that the cumulant
generating function of an AFI model satisfies a generalized convolution Riccati

Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{117}, 8101 (2016)] that the self-interaction may
localize the organism above a critical coupling $\chi_c$ to the trail. Here we

1070,Two-Player Games for Efficient Non-Convex Constrained Optimization,"  In recent years, constrained optimization has become increasingly relevant to
the machine learning community, with applications including Neyman-Pearson
classification, robust optimization, and fair machine learning. A natural
approach to constrained optimization is to optimize the Lagrangian, but this is
not guaranteed to work in the non-convex setting, and, if using a first-order
method, cannot cope with non-differentiable constraints (e.g. constraints on
rates or proportions).
The Lagrangian can be interpreted as a two-player game played between a
player who seeks to optimize over the model parameters, and a player who wishes
to maximize over the Lagrange multipliers. We propose a non-zero-sum variant of
the Lagrangian formulation that can cope with non-differentiable--even
discontinuous--constraints, which we call the ""proxy-Lagrangian"". The first
player minimizes external regret in terms of easy-to-optimize ""proxy
constraints"", while the second player enforces the original constraints by
minimizing swap regret.
For this new formulation, as for the Lagrangian in the non-convex setting,
the result is a stochastic classifier. For both the proxy-Lagrangian and
Lagrangian formulations, however, we prove that this classifier, instead of
having unbounded size, can be taken to be a distribution over no more than m+1
models (where m is the number of constraints). This is a significant
improvement in practical terms.

1071,Manifold Mixup: Learning Better Representations by Interpolating Hidden States,"  Deep networks often perform well on the data distribution on which they are
trained, yet give incorrect (and often very confident) answers when evaluated
on points from off of the training distribution. This is exemplified by the
adversarial examples phenomenon but can also be seen in terms of model
generalization and domain shift. Ideally, a model would assign lower confidence
to points unlike those from the training distribution. We propose a regularizer
which addresses this issue by training with interpolated hidden states and
encouraging the classifier to be less confident at these points. Because the
hidden states are learned, this has an important effect of encouraging the
hidden states for a class to be concentrated in such a way so that
interpolations within the same class or between two different classes do not
intersect with the real data points from other classes. This has a major
advantage in that it avoids the underfitting which can result from
interpolating in the input space. We prove that the exact condition for this
problem of underfitting to be avoided by Manifold Mixup is that the
dimensionality of the hidden states exceeds the number of classes, which is
often the case in practice. Additionally, this concentration can be seen as
making the features in earlier layers more discriminative. We show that despite
requiring no significant additional computation, Manifold Mixup achieves large
improvements over strong baselines in supervised learning, robustness to
single-step adversarial attacks, semi-supervised learning, and Negative
Log-Likelihood on held out samples.

such as service discovery, selection, and composition. In recent years, machine
learning techniques have been used for service classification. However, they
can only predict around 10 to 20 service categories due to the quality of
feature engineering and the imbalance problem of service dataset. In this
paper, we present a deep neural network ServeNet with a novel dataset splitting
algorithm to deal with these issues. ServeNet can automatically abstract
low-level representation to high-level features, and then predict service
classification based on the service datasets produced by the proposed splitting
algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a
comprehensive experimental study on 10,000 real-world services in 50
categories. The result shows that ServeNet can achieve higher accuracy than
other machine learning methods.

1073,"Pinned, locked, pushed, and pulled traveling waves in structured environments","  Traveling fronts describe the transition between two alternative states in a
great number of physical and biological systems. Examples include the spread of
beneficial mutations, chemical reactions, and the invasions by foreign species.
In homogeneous environments, the alternative states are separated by a smooth
front moving at a constant velocity. This simple picture can break down in
structured environments such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic
devices. Habitat fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or
lock invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not
sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined by the
spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The synchronization with
the environment results in discontinuous fronts that propagate as periodic
pulses. We characterize the transition from continuous to locked invasions and
show that it is controlled by positive density-dependence in dispersal or
growth. We also demonstrate that velocity locking is robust to demographic and
environmental fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in
locked invasions.

activities? How does the migration of workers among firms and industries
contribute to the diffusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry,
occupation, and location-specific knowledge carried by workers from one
establishment to the next using a dataset summarizing the individual work
history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms--firms operating in an
industry that was not present in a region--because the success of pioneers is
the basic unit of regional economic diversification. We find that the growth
and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are
workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the
same location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare
these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that
industry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than
non-pioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which
leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for
local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding
that industry-related knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of
pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of the micro-mechanisms
underlying regional economic diversification events.

1075,A general class of quasi-independence tests for left-truncated right-censored data,"  In survival studies, classical inferences for left-truncated data require
quasi-independence, a property that the joint density of truncation time and
failure time is factorizable into their marginal densities in the observable
region. The quasi-independence hypothesis is testable; many authors have
developed tests for left-truncated data with or without right-censoring. In
this paper, we propose a class of test statistics for testing the
quasi-independence which unifies the existing methods and generates new useful
statistics such as conditional Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
Asymptotic normality of the proposed class of statistics is given. We show that
a new set of tests can be powerful under certain alternatives by theoretical

environmental and geographic factors. Increasing socio-economic and health
disparities in the United States are propagating the longevity-gap, making it a
cause for concern. Earlier studies have probed individual factors but an
integrated picture to reveal quantifiable actions has been missing. There is a
growing concern about a further widening of healthcare inequality caused by
Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to differential access to AI-driven services.
Hence, it is imperative to explore and exploit the potential of AI for
illuminating biases and enabling transparent policy decisions for positive
social and health impact. In this work, we reveal actionable interventions for
decreasing the longevity-gap in the United States by analyzing a County-level
data resource containing healthcare, socio-economic, behavioral, education and
demographic features. We learn an ensemble-averaged structure, draw inferences
using the joint probability distribution and extend it to a Bayesian Decision
Network for identifying policy actions. We draw quantitative estimates for the
impact of diversity, preventive-care quality and stable-families within the

1078,A Generative Model for Natural Sounds Based on Latent Force Modelling,"  Recent advances in analysis of subband amplitude envelopes of natural sounds
have resulted in convincing synthesis, showing subband amplitudes to be a
crucial component of perception. Probabilistic latent variable analysis is
particularly revealing, but existing approaches don't incorporate prior
knowledge about the physical behaviour of amplitude envelopes, such as
exponential decay and feedback. We use latent force modelling, a probabilistic
learning paradigm that incorporates physical knowledge into Gaussian process
regression, to model correlation across spectral subband envelopes. We augment
the standard latent force model approach by explicitly modelling correlations
over multiple time steps. Incorporating this prior knowledge strengthens the
interpretation of the latent functions as the source that generated the signal.
We examine this interpretation via an experiment which shows that sounds
generated by sampling from our probabilistic model are perceived to be more

1079,Noise Statistics Oblivious GARD For Robust Regression With Sparse Outliers,"  Linear regression models contaminated by Gaussian noise (inlier) and possibly
unbounded sparse outliers are common in many signal processing applications.
Sparse recovery inspired robust regression (SRIRR) techniques are shown to
deliver high quality estimation performance in such regression models.
Unfortunately, most SRIRR techniques assume \textit{a priori} knowledge of
noise statistics like inlier noise variance or outlier statistics like number
of outliers. Both inlier and outlier noise statistics are rarely known
\textit{a priori} and this limits the efficient operation of many SRIRR
algorithms. This article proposes a novel noise statistics oblivious algorithm
called residual ratio thresholding GARD (RRT-GARD) for robust regression in the
presence of sparse outliers. RRT-GARD is developed by modifying the recently
proposed noise statistics dependent greedy algorithm for robust de-noising
(GARD). Both finite sample and asymptotic analytical results indicate that
RRT-GARD performs nearly similar to GARD with \textit{a priori} knowledge of
noise statistics. Numerical simulations in real and synthetic data sets also
point to the highly competitive performance of RRT-GARD.

1080,Adjusting for bias introduced by instrumental variable estimation in the Cox Proportional Hazards Model,"  Instrumental variable (IV) methods are widely used for estimating average
treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured confounders. However, the
capability of existing IV procedures, and most notably the two-stage residual
inclusion (2SRI) procedure recommended for use in nonlinear contexts, to
account for unmeasured confounders in the Cox proportional hazard model is
unclear. We show that instrumenting an endogenous treatment induces an
unmeasured covariate, referred to as an individual frailty in survival analysis
parlance, which if not accounted for leads to bias. We propose a new procedure
that augments 2SRI with an individual frailty and prove that it is consistent
under certain conditions. The finite sample-size behavior is studied across a
broad set of conditions via Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the proposed
methodology is used to estimate the average effect of carotid endarterectomy
versus carotid artery stenting on the mortality of patients suffering from
carotid artery disease. Results suggest that the 2SRI-frailty estimator
generally reduces the bias of both point and interval estimators compared to
traditional 2SRI.

$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$. To derive the lower bound, we prove a global structural
result on a decomposition of rooted binary trees into subgroups of leaves
called blobs. To obtain the upper bound, we generalize a first moment argument
for random tree distributions that are exchangeable and not necessarily

1082,The Broad Consequences of Narrow Banking,"  We investigate the macroeconomic consequences of narrow banking in the
context of stock-flow consistent models. We begin with an extension of the
Goodwin-Keen model incorporating time deposits, government bills, cash, and
central bank reserves to the base model with loans and demand deposits and use
it to describe a fractional reserve banking system. We then characterize narrow
banking by a full reserve requirement on demand deposits and describe the
resulting separation between the payment system and lending functions of the
resulting banking sector. By way of numerical examples, we explore the
properties of fractional and full reserve versions of the model and compare
their asymptotic properties. We find that narrow banking does not lead to any
loss in economic growth when the models converge to a finite equilibrium, while
allowing for more direct monitoring and prevention of financial breakdowns in
the case of explosive asymptotic behaviour.

1083,"Neurofeedback: principles, appraisal and outstanding issues","  Neurofeedback is a form of brain training in which subjects are fed back
information about some measure of their brain activity which they are
instructed to modify in a way thought to be functionally advantageous. Over the
last twenty years, NF has been used to treat various neurological and
psychiatric conditions, and to improve cognitive function in various contexts.
However, despite its growing popularity, each of the main steps in NF comes
with its own set of often covert assumptions. Here we critically examine some
conceptual and methodological issues associated with the way general objectives
and neural targets of NF are defined, and review the neural mechanisms through
which NF may act, and the way its efficacy is gauged. The NF process is
characterised in terms of functional dynamics, and possible ways in which it
may be controlled are discussed. Finally, it is proposed that improving NF will
require better understanding of various fundamental aspects of brain dynamics
and a more precise definition of functional brain activity and brain-behaviour

1084,Linear compartmental models: input-output equations and operations that preserve identifiability,"  This work focuses on the question of how identifiability of a mathematical
model, that is, whether parameters can be recovered from data, is related to
identifiability of its submodels. We look specifically at linear compartmental
models and investigate when identifiability is preserved after adding or
removing model components. In particular, we examine whether identifiability is
preserved when an input, output, edge, or leak is added or deleted. Our
approach, via differential algebra, is to analyze specific input-output
equations of a model and the Jacobian of the associated coefficient map. We
clarify a prior determinantal formula for these equations, and then use it to
prove that, under some hypotheses, a model's input-output equations can be
understood in terms of certain submodels we call ""output-reachable"". Our proofs
use algebraic and combinatorial techniques.

1085,"On Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction, Linear Smoothing and Autoencoding","  We develop theory for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR). A number of
NLDR methods have been developed, but there is limited understanding of how
these methods work and the relationships between them. There is limited basis
for using existing NLDR theory for deriving new algorithms. We provide a novel
framework for analysis of NLDR via a connection to the statistical theory of
linear smoothers. This allows us to both understand existing methods and derive
new ones. We use this connection to smoothing to show that asymptotically,
existing NLDR methods correspond to discrete approximations of the solutions of
sets of differential equations given a boundary condition. In particular, we
can characterize many existing methods in terms of just three limiting
differential operators and boundary conditions. Our theory also provides a way
to assert that one method is preferable to another; indeed, we show Local
Tangent Space Alignment is superior within a class of methods that assume a
global coordinate chart defines an isometric embedding of the manifold.

1086,CM3: Cooperative Multi-goal Multi-stage Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning,"  We propose CM3, a new deep reinforcement learning method for cooperative
multi-agent problems where agents must coordinate for joint success in
achieving different individual goals. We restructure multi-agent learning into
a two-stage curriculum, consisting of a single-agent stage for learning to
accomplish individual tasks, followed by a multi-agent stage for learning to
cooperate in the presence of other agents. These two stages are bridged by
modular augmentation of neural network policy and value functions. We further
adapt the actor-critic framework to this curriculum by formulating local and
global views of the policy gradient and learning via a double critic,
consisting of a decentralized value function and a centralized action-value
function. We evaluated CM3 on a new high-dimensional multi-agent environment
with sparse rewards: negotiating lane changes among multiple autonomous
vehicles in the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator. Detailed
ablation experiments show the positive contribution of each component in CM3,
and the overall synthesis converges significantly faster to higher performance
policies than existing cooperative multi-agent methods.

1087,Fighting Accounting Fraud Through Forensic Data Analytics,"  Accounting fraud is a global concern representing a significant threat to the
financial system stability due to the resulting diminishing of the market
confidence and trust of regulatory authorities. Several tricks can be used to
commit accounting fraud, hence the need for non-static regulatory interventions
that take into account different fraudulent patterns. Accordingly, this study
aims to improve the detection of accounting fraud via the implementation of
several machine learning methods to better differentiate between fraud and
non-fraud companies, and to further assist the task of examination within the
riskier firms by evaluating relevant financial indicators. Out-of-sample
results suggest there is a great potential in detecting falsified financial
statements through statistical modelling and analysis of publicly available
accounting information. The proposed methodology can be of assistance to public
auditors and regulatory agencies as it facilitates auditing processes, and
supports more targeted and effective examinations of accounting reports.

1088,Doubly Stochastic Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes,"  Gaussian processes (GPs) are a good choice for function approximation as they
are flexible, robust to over-fitting, and provide well-calibrated predictive
uncertainty. Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer generalisations of
GPs, but inference in these models has proved challenging. Existing approaches
to inference in DGP models assume approximate posteriors that force
independence between the layers, and do not work well in practice. We present a
doubly stochastic variational inference algorithm, which does not force
independence between layers. With our method of inference we demonstrate that a
DGP model can be used effectively on data ranging in size from hundreds to a
billion points. We provide strong empirical evidence that our inference scheme
for DGPs works well in practice in both classification and regression.

1090,Eigensolutions and spectral analysis of a model for vertical gene transfer of plasmids,"  Plasmids are autonomously replicating genetic elements in bacteria. At cell
division plasmids are distributed among the two daughter cells. This gene
transfer from one generation to the next is called vertical gene transfer. We
study the dynamics of a bacterial population carrying plasmids and are in
particular interested in the long-time distribution of plasmids. Starting with
a model for a bacterial population structured by the discrete number of
plasmids, we proceed to the continuum limit in order to derive a continuous
model. The model incorporates plasmid reproduction, division and death of
bacteria, and distribution of plasmids at cell division. It is a hyperbolic
integro-differential equation and a so-called growth-fragmentation-death model.
As we are interested in the long-time distribution of plasmids we study the
associated eigenproblem and show existence of eigensolutions. The stability of
this solution is studied by analyzing the spectrum of the integro-differential
operator given by the eigenproblem. By relating the spectrum with the spectrum
of an integral operator we find a simple real dominating eigenvalue with a
non-negative corresponding eigenfunction. Moreover, we describe an iterative
method for the numerical construction of the eigenfunction.

1091,Spatial risk measures and rate of spatial diversification,"  An accurate assessment of the risk of extreme environmental events is of
great importance for populations, authorities and the banking/insurance
industry. Koch (2017) introduced a notion of spatial risk measure and a
corresponding set of axioms which are well suited to analyze the risk due to
events having a spatial extent, precisely such as environmental phenomena. The
axiom of asymptotic spatial homogeneity is of particular interest since it
allows one to quantify the rate of spatial diversification when the region
under consideration becomes large. In this paper, we first investigate the
general concepts of spatial risk measures and corresponding axioms further. We
also explain the usefulness of this theory for the actuarial practice. Second,
in the case of a general cost field, we especially give sufficient conditions
such that spatial risk measures associated with expectation, variance,
Value-at-Risk as well as expected shortfall and induced by this cost field
satisfy the axioms of asymptotic spatial homogeneity of order 0, -2, -1 and -1,
respectively. Last but not least, in the case where the cost field is a
function of a max-stable random field, we mainly provide conditions on both the
function and the max-stable field ensuring the latter properties. Max-stable
random fields are relevant when assessing the risk of extreme events since they
appear as a natural extension of multivariate extreme-value theory to the level
of random fields. Overall, this paper improves our understanding of spatial
risk measures as well as of their properties with respect to the space variable
and generalizes many results obtained in Koch (2017).

study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the MLE by means of CE method
for different parameter settings and sample sizes. The results are compared to

1093,Congenial Causal Inference with Binary Structural Nested Mean Models,"  Structural nested mean models (SNMMs) are among the fundamental tools for
inferring causal effects of time-dependent exposures from longitudinal studies.
With binary outcomes, however, current methods for estimating multiplicative
and additive SNMM parameters suffer from variation dependence between the
causal SNMM parameters and the non-causal nuisance parameters. Estimating
methods for logistic SNMMs do not suffer from this dependence. Unfortunately,
in contrast with the multiplicative and additive models, unbiased estimation of
the causal parameters of a logistic SNMM rely on additional modeling
assumptions even when the treatment probabilities are known. These difficulties
have hindered the uptake of SNMMs in epidemiological practice, where binary
outcomes are common. We solve the variation dependence problem for the binary
multiplicative SNMM by a reparametrization of the non-causal nuisance
parameters. Our novel nuisance parameters are variation independent of the
causal parameters, and hence allows the fitting of a multiplicative SNMM by
unconstrained maximum likelihood. It also allows one to construct true (i.e.
congenial) doubly robust estimators of the causal parameters. Along the way, we
prove that an additive SNMM with binary outcomes does not admit a variation
independent parametrization, thus explaining why we restrict ourselves to the
multiplicative SNMM.

algorithm development in this paper. Six months of driving information from the
city of Ann Arbor is collected from 2,000 vehicles. The road grade information
from more than 1,100 km of road network is modeled and the software Autonomie
is used to calculate fuel consumption for all trips on the road network. Four
different routing strategies including shortest distance, shortest time,
eco-routing, and travel-time-constrained eco-routing are compared. The results
show that eco-routing can reduce fuel consumption, but may increase travel
time. A travel-time-constrained eco-routing algorithm is developed to keep most
the fuel saving benefit while incurring very little increase in travel time.

1095,Distributions-oriented wind forecast verification by a hidden Markov model for multivariate circular-linear data,"  Winds from the North-West quadrant and lack of precipitation are known to
lead to an increase of PM10 concentrations over a residential neighborhood in
the city of Taranto (Italy). In 2012 the local government prescribed a
reduction of industrial emissions by 10% every time such meteorological
conditions are forecasted 72 hours in advance. Wind forecasting is addressed
using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric simulation system
by the Regional Environmental Protection Agency. In the context of
distributions-oriented forecast verification, we propose a comprehensive
model-based inferential approach to investigate the ability of the WRF system
to forecast the local wind speed and direction allowing different performances
for unknown weather regimes. Ground-observed and WRF-forecasted wind speed and
direction at a relevant location are jointly modeled as a 4-dimensional time
series with an unknown finite number of states characterized by homogeneous
distributional behavior. The proposed model relies on a mixture of joint
projected and skew normal distributions with time-dependent states, where the
temporal evolution of the state membership follows a first order Markov
process. Parameter estimates, including the number of states, are obtained by a
Bayesian MCMC-based method. Results provide useful insights on the performance
of WRF forecasts in relation to different combinations of wind speed and
direction.

1096,The Rank Effect,"  We decompose returns for portfolios of bottom-ranked, lower-priced assets
relative to the market into rank crossovers and changes in the relative price
of those bottom-ranked assets. This decomposition is general and consistent
with virtually any asset pricing model. Crossovers measure changes in rank and
are smoothly increasing over time, while return fluctuations are driven by
volatile relative price changes. Our results imply that in a closed,
dividend-free market in which the relative price of bottom-ranked assets is
approximately constant, a portfolio of those bottom-ranked assets will
outperform the market portfolio over time. We show that bottom-ranked relative
commodity futures prices have increased only slightly, and confirm the
existence of substantial excess returns predicted by our theory. If these
excess returns did not exist, then top-ranked relative prices would have had to
be much higher in 2018 than those actually observed -- this would imply a
radically different commodity price distribution.

1097,Flux cost functions and the choice of metabolic fluxes,"  Metabolic fluxes in cells are governed by physical, biochemical,
physiological, and economic principles. Cells may show ""economical"" behaviour,
trading metabolic performance against the costly side-effects of high enzyme or
metabolite concentrations. Some constraint-based flux prediction methods score
fluxes by heuristic flux costs as proxies of enzyme investments. However,
linear cost functions ignore enzyme kinetics and the tight coupling between
fluxes, metabolite levels and enzyme levels. To derive more realistic cost
functions, I define an apparent ""enzymatic flux cost"" as the minimal enzyme
cost at which the fluxes can be realised in a given kinetic model, and a
""kinetic flux cost"", which includes metabolite cost. I discuss the mathematical
properties of such flux cost functions, their usage for flux prediction, and
their importance for cells' metabolic strategies. The enzymatic flux cost
scales linearly with the fluxes and is a concave function on the flux polytope.
The costs of two flows are usually not additive, due to an additional
""compromise cost"". Between flux polytopes, where fluxes change their
directions, the enzymatic cost shows a jump. With strictly concave flux cost
functions, cells can reduce their enzymatic cost by running different fluxes in
different cell compartments or at different moments in time. The enzymactic
flux cost can be translated into an approximated cell growth rate, a convex
function on the flux polytope. Growth-maximising metabolic states can be
predicted by Flux Cost Minimisation (FCM), a variant of FBA based on general
flux cost functions. The solutions are flux distributions in corners of the
flux polytope, i.e. typically elementary flux modes. Enzymatic flux costs can
be linearly or nonlinearly approximated, providing model parameters for linear
FBA based on kinetic parameters and extracellular concentrations, and justified
by a kinetic model.

1098,DeepArchitect: Automatically Designing and Training Deep Architectures,"  In deep learning, performance is strongly affected by the choice of
architecture and hyperparameters. While there has been extensive work on
automatic hyperparameter optimization for simple spaces, complex spaces such as
the space of deep architectures remain largely unexplored. As a result, the
choice of architecture is done manually by the human expert through a slow
trial and error process guided mainly by intuition. In this paper we describe a
framework for automatically designing and training deep models. We propose an
extensible and modular language that allows the human expert to compactly
represent complex search spaces over architectures and their hyperparameters.
The resulting search spaces are tree-structured and therefore easy to traverse.
Models can be automatically compiled to computational graphs once values for
all hyperparameters have been chosen. We can leverage the structure of the
search space to introduce different model search algorithms, such as random
search, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), and sequential model-based optimization
(SMBO). We present experiments comparing the different algorithms on CIFAR-10
and show that MCTS and SMBO outperform random search. In addition, these
experiments show that our framework can be used effectively for model
discovery, as it is possible to describe expressive search spaces and discover
competitive models without much effort from the human expert. Code for our
framework and experiments has been made publicly available.

1099,AFT*: Integrating Active Learning and Transfer Learning to Reduce Annotation Efforts,"  The splendid success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer
vision is largely attributed to the availability of large annotated datasets,
such as ImageNet and Places. However, in biomedical imaging, it is very
challenging to create such large annotated datasets, as annotating biomedical
images is not only tedious, laborious, and time consuming, but also demanding
of costly, specialty-oriented skills, which are not easily accessible. To
dramatically reduce annotation cost, this paper presents a novel method to
naturally integrate active learning and transfer learning (fine-tuning) into a
single framework, called AFT*, which starts directly with a pre-trained CNN to
seek ""worthy"" samples for annotation and gradually enhance the (fine-tuned) CNN
via continuous fine-tuning. We have evaluated our method in three distinct
biomedical imaging applications, demonstrating that it can cut the annotation
cost by at least half, in comparison with the state-of-the-art method. This
performance is attributed to the several advantages derived from the advanced
active, continuous learning capability of our method. Although AFT* was
initially conceived in the context of computer-aided diagnosis in biomedical
imaging, it is generic and applicable to many tasks in computer vision and
image analysis; we illustrate the key ideas behind AFT* with the Places
database for scene interpretation in natural images.

1101,Self-sustained activity in balanced networks with low firing-rate,"  The brain can display self-sustained activity (SSA), which is the persistent
firing of neurons in the absence of external stimuli. This spontaneous activity
shows low neuronal firing rates and is observed in diverse in vitro and in vivo
situations. In this work, we study the influence of excitatory/inhibitory
balance, connection density, and network size on the self-sustained activity of
a neuronal network model. We build a random network of adaptive exponential
integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neuron models connected through inhibitory and
excitatory chemical synapses. The AdEx model mimics several behaviours of
biological neurons, such as spike initiation, adaptation, and bursting
patterns. In an excitation/inhibition balanced state, if the mean connection
degree (K) is fixed, the firing rate does not depend on the network size (N),
whereas for fixed N, the firing rate decreases when K increases. However, for
large K, SSA states can appear only for large N. We show the existence of SSA
states with similar behaviours to those observed in experimental recordings,
such as very low and irregular neuronal firing rates, and spike-train power
spectra with slow fluctuations, only for balanced networks of large size.

influence the alignments of nearby galaxies. We study this effect in the LOWZ
sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using the ""Cosmic Web Reconstruction""
filament catalogue of Chen et al. (2016). We find that LOWZ galaxies exhibit a
small but statistically significant alignment in the direction parallel to the
orientation of nearby filaments. This effect is detectable even in the absence
of nearby galaxy clusters, which suggests it is an effect from the matter
distribution in the filament. A nonparametric regression model suggests that
the alignment effect with filaments extends over separations of $30-40$ Mpc. We
find that galaxies that are bright and early-forming align more strongly with
the directions of nearby filaments than those that are faint and late-forming;
however, trends with stellar mass are less statistically significant, within
the narrow range of stellar mass of this sample.

1104,Machine Learning Meets Microeconomics: The Case of Decision Trees and Discrete Choice,"  We provide a microeconomic framework for decision trees: a popular machine
learning method. Specifically, we show how decision trees represent a
non-compensatory decision protocol known as disjunctions-of-conjunctions and
how this protocol generalizes many of the non-compensatory rules used in the
discrete choice literature so far. Additionally, we show how existing decision
tree variants address many economic concerns that choice modelers might have.
Beyond theoretical interpretations, we contribute to the existing literature of
two-stage, semi-compensatory modeling and to the existing decision tree
literature. In particular, we formulate the first bayesian model tree, thereby
allowing for uncertainty in the estimated non-compensatory rules as well as for
context-dependent preference heterogeneity in one's second-stage choice model.
Using an application of bicycle mode choice in the San Francisco Bay Area, we
estimate our bayesian model tree, and we find that it is over 1,000 times more
likely to be closer to the true data-generating process than a multinomial
logit model (MNL). Qualitatively, our bayesian model tree automatically finds
the effect of bicycle infrastructure investment to be moderated by travel
distance, socio-demographics and topography, and our model identifies
diminishing returns from bike lane investments. These qualitative differences
lead to bayesian model tree forecasts that directly align with the observed
bicycle mode shares in regions with abundant bicycle infrastructure such as
Davis, CA and the Netherlands. In comparison, MNL's forecasts are overly
optimistic.

a weighted version of the Kendall kernel, which allows to weight unequally the
contributions of different item pairs in the permutations depending on their
ranks. Like the Kendall kernel, we show that the weighted version is invariant
to relabeling of items and can be computed efficiently in $O(n \ln(n))$
operations, where $n$ is the number of items in the permutation. Second, we
propose a supervised approach to learn the weights by jointly optimizing them
with the function estimated by a kernel machine. Third, while the Kendall
kernel considers pairwise comparison between items, we extend it by considering
higher-order comparisons among tuples of items and show that the supervised
approach of learning the weights can be systematically generalized to
higher-order permutation kernels.

single-level and multilevel models, which are fitted with the probabilistic

Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or
semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. To make all
of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an
intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula
syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in
detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing other

1108,The Risk of Machine Learning,"  Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation
of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often
interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher
effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction
models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that
combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization
parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the
performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge,
lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many
parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i)
the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven
selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the
risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative
performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To
address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters,
based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield
estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal
(unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent
examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical
applicability of our results.

1109,A Probabilistic Disease Progression Model for Predicting Future Clinical Outcome,"  In this work, we consider the problem of predicting the course of a
progressive disease, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Progressive diseases often
start with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis, and each patient
follows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability,
which can be associated with many factors such as genotype, age, or sex. An
additional layer of complexity is that, in real life, the amount and type of
data available for each patient can differ significantly. For example, for one
patient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might
have detailed clinical assessments obtained at multiple prior time-points. This
paper presents a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities
(including images and clinical assessments) and variable patient histories with
irregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical scores at future
time-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression,
which gives rise to clinical observations in our generative model. We
implemented an approximate Bayesian inference strategy on the proposed model to
estimate the parameters on data from a large population of subjects.
Furthermore, the Bayesian framework enables the model to automatically
fine-tune its predictions based on historical observations that might be
available on the test subject. We applied our method to a longitudinal
Alzheimer's disease dataset with more than 3000 subjects [23] and present a
detailed empirical analysis of prediction performance under different
scenarios, with comparisons against several benchmarks. We also demonstrate how
the proposed model can be interrogated to glean insights about temporal
dynamics in Alzheimer's disease.

approach to use predictors, such as Decision Trees (DT), within a standard
optimization framework for pre- and post-fault control purposes. In particular,
we present a generalizable method for embedding rules derived from DTs in an
operation decision-making model. We begin by pointing out the specific
challenges entailed when moving from a prediction to a control framework. We
proceed with introducing the solution strategy based on generalized disjunctive
programming (GDP) as well as a two-step search method for identifying optimal
hyper-parameters for balancing cost and control accuracy. We showcase how the
proposed approach constructs security proxies that cover multiple contingencies
while facing high-dimensional uncertainty with respect to operating conditions
with the use of a case study on the IEEE 39-bus system. The method is shown to
achieve efficient system control at a marginal increase in system price
compared to an oracle model.

1111,Estimation of Covariance Matrices for Portfolio Optimization using Gaussian Processes,"  Estimating covariances between financial assets plays an important role in
risk management and optimal portfolio allocation. In practice, when the sample
size is small compared to the number of variables, i.e. when considering a wide
universe of assets over just a few years, this poses considerable challenges
and the empirical estimate is known to be very unstable.
Here, we propose a novel covariance estimator based on the Gaussian Process
Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM). Our estimator can be considered as a non-linear
extension of standard factor models with readily interpretable parameters
reminiscent of market betas. Furthermore, our Bayesian treatment naturally
shrinks the sample covariance matrix towards a more structured matrix given by
the prior and thereby systematically reduces estimation errors.

1112,MM Algorithms for Variance Component Estimation and Selection in Logistic Linear Mixed Model,"  Logistic linear mixed model is widely used in experimental designs and
genetic analysis with binary traits. Motivated by modern applications, we
consider the case with many groups of random effects and each group corresponds
to a variance component. When the number of variance components is large,
fitting the logistic linear mixed model is challenging. We develop two
efficient and stable minorization-maximization (MM) algorithms for the
estimation of variance components based on the Laplace approximation of the
logistic model. One of them leads to a simple iterative soft-thresholding
algorithm for variance component selection using maximum penalized approximated
likelihood. We demonstrate the variance component estimation and selection
performance of our algorithms by simulation studies and a real data analysis.

1113,Visual Reasoning with Multi-hop Feature Modulation,"  Recent breakthroughs in computer vision and natural language processing have
spurred interest in challenging multi-modal tasks such as visual
question-answering and visual dialogue. For such tasks, one successful approach
is to condition image-based convolutional network computation on language via
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers, i.e., per-channel scaling and
shifting. We propose to generate the parameters of FiLM layers going up the
hierarchy of a convolutional network in a multi-hop fashion rather than all at
once, as in prior work. By alternating between attending to the language input
and generating FiLM layer parameters, this approach is better able to scale to
settings with longer input sequences such as dialogue. We demonstrate that
multi-hop FiLM generation achieves state-of-the-art for the short input
sequence task ReferIt --- on-par with single-hop FiLM generation --- while also
significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art and single-hop FiLM
generation on the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue task.

1114,Behavioral-clinical phenotyping with type 2 diabetes self-monitoring data,"  Objective: To evaluate unsupervised clustering methods for identifying
individual-level behavioral-clinical phenotypes that relate personal biomarkers
and behavioral traits in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) self-monitoring data. Materials
and Methods: We used hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify groups of meals
with similar nutrition and glycemic impact for 6 individuals with T2DM who
collected self-monitoring data. We evaluated clusters on: 1) correspondence to
gold standards generated by certified diabetes educators (CDEs) for 3
participants; 2) face validity, rated by CDEs, and 3) impact on CDEs' ability
to identify patterns for another 3 participants. Results: Gold standard (GS)
included 9 patterns across 3 participants. Of these, all 9 were re-discovered
using HC: 4 GS patterns were consistent with patterns identified by HC (over
50% of meals in a cluster followed the pattern); another 5 were included as
sub-groups in broader clusers. 50% (9/18) of clusters were rated over 3 on
5-point Likert scale for validity, significance, and being actionable. After
reviewing clusters, CDEs identified patterns that were more consistent with
data (70% reduction in contradictions between patterns and participants'
records). Discussion: Hierarchical clustering of blood glucose and
macronutrient consumption appears suitable for discovering behavioral-clinical
phenotypes in T2DM. Most clusters corresponded to gold standard and were rated
positively by CDEs for face validity. Cluster visualizations helped CDEs
identify more robust patterns in nutrition and glycemic impact, creating new
possibilities for visual analytic solutions. Conclusion: Machine learning
methods can use diabetes self-monitoring data to create personalized
behavioral-clinical phenotypes, which may prove useful for delivering
personalized medicine.

1115,Deep learning to achieve clinically applicable segmentation of head and neck anatomy for radiotherapy,"  Over half a million individuals are diagnosed with head and neck cancer each
year worldwide. Radiotherapy is an important curative treatment for this
disease, but it requires manually intensive delineation of radiosensitive
organs at risk (OARs). This planning process can delay treatment commencement.
While auto-segmentation algorithms offer a potentially time-saving solution,
the challenges in defining, quantifying and achieving expert performance
remain. Adopting a deep learning approach, we demonstrate a 3D U-Net
architecture that achieves performance similar to experts in delineating a wide
range of head and neck OARs. The model was trained on a dataset of 663
deidentified computed tomography (CT) scans acquired in routine clinical
practice and segmented according to consensus OAR definitions. We demonstrate
its generalisability through application to an independent test set of 24 CT
scans available from The Cancer Imaging Archive collected at multiple
international sites previously unseen to the model, each segmented by two
independent experts and consisting of 21 OARs commonly segmented in clinical
practice. With appropriate validation studies and regulatory approvals, this
system could improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy pathways.

1116,Algorithmic Trading with Fitted Q Iteration and Heston Model,"  We present the use of the fitted Q iteration in algorithmic trading. We show
that the fitted Q iteration helps alleviate the dimension problem that the
basic Q-learning algorithm faces in application to trading. Furthermore, we
introduce a procedure including model fitting and data simulation to enrich
training data as the lack of data is often a problem in realistic application.
We experiment our method on both simulated environment that permits arbitrage
opportunity and real-world environment by using prices of 450 stocks. In the
former environment, the method performs well, implying that our method works in
theory. To perform well in the real-world environment, the agents trained might
require more training (iteration) and more meaningful variables with predictive
value.

1117,Univariate and Bivariate Geometric Discrete Generalized Exponential Distributions,"  Marshall and Olkin (1997, Biometrika, 84, 641 - 652) introduced a very
powerful method to introduce an additional parameter to a class of continuous
distribution functions and hence it brings more flexibility to the model. They
have demonstrated their method for the exponential and Weibull classes. In the
same paper they have briefly indicated regarding its bivariate extension. The
main aim of this paper is to introduce the same method, for the first time, to
the class of discrete generalized exponential distributions both for the
univariate and bivariate cases. We investigate several properties of the
proposed univariate and bivariate classes. The univariate class has three
parameters, whereas the bivariate class has five parameters. It is observed
that depending on the parameter values the univariate class can be both zero
inflated as well as heavy tailed. We propose to use EM algorithm to estimate
the unknown parameters. Small simulation experiments have been performed to see
the effectiveness of the proposed EM algorithm, and a bivariate data set has
been analyzed and it is observed that the proposed models and the EM algorithm
work quite well in practice.

1118,Global stability of a network-based SIRS epidemic model with nonmonotone incidence rate,"  This paper studies the dynamics of a network-based SIRS epidemic model with
vaccination and a nonmonotone incidence rate. This type of nonlinear incidence
can be used to describe the psychological or inhibitory effect from the
behavioral change of the susceptible individuals when the number of infective
individuals on heterogeneous networks is getting larger. Using the analytical
method, epidemic threshold $R_0$ is obtained. When $R_0$ is less than one, we
prove the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the
disease dies out, while $R_0$ is greater than one, there exists a unique
endemic equilibrium. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, we also
prove the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if the
inhibitory factor $\alpha$ is sufficiently large. Numerical experiments are
also given to support the theoretical results. It is shown both theoretically
and numerically a larger $\alpha$ can accelerate the extinction of the disease
and reduce the level of disease.

1119,Generalizations of the 'Linear Chain Trick': Incorporating more flexible dwell time distributions into mean field ODE models,"  Mathematical modelers have long known of a ""rule of thumb"" referred to as the
Linear Chain Trick (LCT; aka the Gamma Chain Trick): a technique used to
construct mean field ODE models from continuous-time stochastic state
transition models where the time an individual spends in a given state (i.e.,
the dwell time) is Erlang distributed (i.e., gamma distributed with integer
shape parameter). Despite the LCT's widespread use, we lack general theory to
facilitate the easy application of this technique, especially for complex
models. This has forced modelers to choose between constructing ODE models
using heuristics with oversimplified dwell time assumptions, using time
consuming derivations from first principles, or to instead use non-ODE models
(like integro-differential equations or delay differential equations) which can
be cumbersome to derive and analyze. Here, we provide analytical results that
enable modelers to more efficiently construct ODE models using the LCT or
related extensions. Specifically, we 1) provide novel extensions of the LCT to
various scenarios found in applications; 2) provide formulations of the LCT and
it's extensions that bypass the need to derive ODEs from integral or stochastic
model equations; and 3) introduce a novel Generalized Linear Chain Trick (GLCT)
framework that extends the LCT to a much broader family of distributions,
including the flexible phase-type distributions which can approximate
distributions on $\mathbb{R}^+$ and be fit to data. These results give modelers
more flexibility to incorporate appropriate dwell time assumptions into mean
field ODEs, including conditional dwell time distributions, and these results
help clarify connections between individual-level stochastic model assumptions
and the structure of corresponding mean field ODEs.

1120,Resampling Strategy in Sequential Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling Problems,"  Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of Monte Carlo methods that
are used to obtain random samples of a high dimensional random variable in a
sequential fashion. Many problems encountered in applications often involve
different types of constraints. These constraints can make the problem much
more challenging. In this paper, we formulate a general framework of using SMC
for constrained sampling problems based on forward and backward pilot
resampling strategies. We review some existing methods under the framework and
develop several new algorithms. It is noted that all information observed or
imposed on the underlying system can be viewed as constraints. Hence the
approach outlined in this paper can be useful in many applications.

1121,Aggressive Economic Incentives and Physical Activity: The Role of Choice and Technology Decision Aids,"  Aggressive incentive schemes that allow individuals to impose economic
punishment on themselves if they fail to meet health goals present a promising
approach for encouraging healthier behavior. However, the element of choice
inherent in these schemes introduces concerns that only non-representative
sectors of the population will select aggressive incentives, leaving value on
the table for those who don't opt in. In a field experiment conducted over a 29
week period on individuals wearing Fitbit activity trackers, we find modest and
short lived increases in physical activity for those provided the choice of
aggressive incentives. In contrast, we find significant and persistent
increases for those assigned (oftentimes against their stated preference) to
the same aggressive incentives. The modest benefits for those provided a choice
seems to emerge because those who benefited most from the aggressive incentives
were the least likely to choose them, and it was those who did not need them
who opted in. These results are confirmed in a follow up lab experiment. We
also find that benefits to individuals assigned to aggressive incentives were
pronounced if they also updated their step target in the Fitbit mobile
application to match the new activity goal we provided them. Our findings have
important implications for incentive based interventions to improve health
behavior. For firms and policy makers, our results suggest that one effective
strategy for encouraging sustained healthy behavior combines exposure to
aggressive incentive schemes to jolt individuals out of their comfort zones
with technology decision aids that help individuals sustain this behavior after
incentives end.

1122,The Unusual Effectiveness of Averaging in GAN Training,"  We show empirically that the optimal strategy of parameter averaging in a
minmax convex-concave game setting is also strikingly effective in the non
convex-concave GAN setting, specifically alleviating the convergence issues
associated with cycling behavior observed in GANs. We show that averaging over
generator parameters outside of the trainig loop consistently improves
inception and FID scores on different architectures and for different GAN
objectives. We provide comprehensive experimental results across a range of
datasets, bilinear games, mixture of Gaussians, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA and
ImageNet, to demonstrate its effectiveness. We achieve state-of-the-art results
on CIFAR-10 and produce clean CelebA face images, demonstrating that averaging
is one of the most effective techniques for training highly performant GANs.

1124,Global Sensitivity Analysis of High Dimensional Neuroscience Models: An Example of Neurovascular Coupling,"  The complexity and size of state-of-the-art cell models have significantly
increased in part due to the requirement that these models possess complex
cellular functions which are thought--but not necessarily proven--to be
important. Modern cell models often involve hundreds of parameters; the values
of these parameters come, more often than not, from animal experiments whose
relationship to the human physiology is weak with very little information on
the errors in these measurements. The concomitant uncertainties in parameter
values result in uncertainties in the model outputs or Quantities of Interest
(QoIs). Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) aims at apportioning to individual
parameters (or sets of parameters) their relative contribution to output
uncertainty thereby introducing a measure of influence or importance of said
parameters. New GSA approaches are required to deal with increased model size
and complexity; a three stage methodology consisting of screening (dimension
reduction), surrogate modeling, and computing Sobol' indices, is presented. The
methodology is used to analyze a physiologically validated numerical model of
neurovascular coupling which possess 160 uncertain parameters. The sensitivity
analysis investigates three quantities of interest (QoIs), the average value of
$K^+$ in the extracellular space, the average volumetric flow rate through the
perfusing vessel, and the minimum value of the actin/myosin complex in the
smooth muscle cell. GSA provides a measure of the influence of each parameter,
for each of the three QoIs, giving insight into areas of possible physiological
dysfunction and areas of further investigation.

1126,Focused Hierarchical RNNs for Conditional Sequence Processing,"  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms have obtained
state-of-the-art results for many sequence processing tasks. Most of these
models use a simple form of encoder with attention that looks over the entire
sequence and assigns a weight to each token independently. We present a
mechanism for focusing RNN encoders for sequence modelling tasks which allows
them to attend to key parts of the input as needed. We formulate this using a
multi-layer conditional sequence encoder that reads in one token at a time and
makes a discrete decision on whether the token is relevant to the context or
question being asked. The discrete gating mechanism takes in the context
embedding and the current hidden state as inputs and controls information flow
into the layer above. We train it using policy gradient methods. We evaluate
this method on several types of tasks with different attributes. First, we
evaluate the method on synthetic tasks which allow us to evaluate the model for
its generalization ability and probe the behavior of the gates in more
controlled settings. We then evaluate this approach on large scale Question
Answering tasks including the challenging MS MARCO and SearchQA tasks. Our
models shows consistent improvements for both tasks over prior work and our
baselines. It has also shown to generalize significantly better on synthetic
tasks as compared to the baselines.

1127,Estimating Phase Duration for SPaT Messages,"  A SPaT (Signal Phase and Timing) message describes for each lane the current
phase at a signalized intersection together with an estimate of the residual
time of that phase. Accurate SPaT messages can be used to construct a speed
profile for a vehicle that reduces its fuel consumption as it approaches or
leaves an intersection. This paper presents SPaT estimation algorithms at an
intersection with a semi-actuated signal, using real-time signal phase
measurements. The algorithms are evaluated using high-resolution data from two
intersections in Montgomery County, MD. The algorithms can be readily
implemented at signal controllers. The study supports three findings. First,
real-time information dramatically improves the accuracy of the prediction of
the residual time compared with prediction based on historical data alone.
Second, as time increases the prediction of the residual time may increase or
decrease. Third, as drivers differently weight errors in predicting `end of
green' and `end of red', drivers on two different approaches may prefer
different estimates of the residual time of the same phase.

crucial. Relative log expression (RLE) plots are a powerful tool for
visualising such variation in high dimensional data. We provide a detailed
examination of these plots, with the aid of examples and simulation, explaining
what they are and what they can reveal. RLE plots are particularly useful for
assessing whether a procedure aimed at removing unwanted variation, i.e. a
normalisation procedure, has been successful. These plots, while originally
devised for gene expression data from microarrays, can also be used to reveal
unwanted variation in many other kinds of high dimensional data, where such
variation can be problematic.

1130,Regularization of the Kernel Matrix via Covariance Matrix Shrinkage Estimation,"  The kernel trick concept, formulated as an inner product in a feature space,
facilitates powerful extensions to many well-known algorithms. While the kernel
matrix involves inner products in the feature space, the sample covariance
matrix of the data requires outer products. Therefore, their spectral
properties are tightly connected. This allows us to examine the kernel matrix
through the sample covariance matrix in the feature space and vice versa. The
use of kernels often involves a large number of features, compared to the
number of observations. In this scenario, the sample covariance matrix is not
well-conditioned nor is it necessarily invertible, mandating a solution to the
problem of estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices under small sample
size conditions. We tackle this problem through the use of a shrinkage
estimator that offers a compromise between the sample covariance matrix and a
well-conditioned matrix (also known as the ""target"") with the aim of minimizing
the mean-squared error (MSE). We propose a distribution-free kernel matrix
regularization approach that is tuned directly from the kernel matrix, avoiding
the need to address the feature space explicitly. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that the proposed regularization is effective in classification
tasks.

conventionally structured system while allowing us to perform approximate
gradient descent using labeled data. While this is only a heuristic procedure,
as far as we are aware there is no other efficient technique for tuning such
systems. We describe the components of the system and the associated supervised
learning mechanism. We also demonstrate the utility of the algorithm by
comparing its performance versus hand tuning for an automotive headlight
controller. Despite having over 100 parameters, the method is able to
profitably adjust the system values given just the desired output for a number

1132,A Structured Approach to the Analysis of Remote Sensing Images,"  The number of studies for the analysis of remote sensing images has been
growing exponentially in the last decades. Many studies, however, only report
results---in the form of certain performance metrics---by a few selected
algorithms on a training and testing sample. While this often yields valuable
insights, it tells little about some important aspects. For example, one might
be interested in understanding the nature of a study by the interaction of
algorithm, features, and the sample as these collectively contribute to the
outcome; among these three, which would be a more productive direction in
improving a study; how to assess the sample quality or the value of a set of
features etc. With a focus on land-use classification, we advocate the use of a
structured analysis. The output of a study is viewed as the result of the
interplay among three input dimensions: feature, sample, and algorithm.
Similarly, another dimension, the error, can be decomposed into error along
each input dimension. Such a structural decomposition of the inputs or error
could help better understand the nature of the problem and potentially suggest
directions for improvement. We use the analysis of a remote sensing image at a
study site in Guangzhou, China, to demonstrate how such a structured analysis
could be carried out and what insights it generates. The structured analysis
could be applied to a new study, or as a diagnosis to an existing one. We
expect this will inform practice in the analysis of remote sensing images, and
help advance the state-of-the-art of land-use classification.

1133,Iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ algorithms with extrapolation,"  Iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ algorithm is a popular algorithm for solving
a large class of optimization problems whose objective is the sum of a
Lipschitz differentiable loss function and a possibly nonconvex sparsity
inducing regularizer. In this paper, motivated by the success of extrapolation
techniques in accelerating first-order methods, we study how widely used
extrapolation techniques such as those in [4,5,22,28] can be incorporated to
possibly accelerate the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ algorithm. We consider
three versions of such algorithms. For each version, we exhibit an explicitly
checkable condition on the extrapolation parameters so that the sequence
generated provably clusters at a stationary point of the optimization problem.
We also investigate global convergence under additional Kurdyka-$\L$ojasiewicz
assumptions on certain potential functions. Our numerical experiments show that
our algorithms usually outperform the general iterative shrinkage and
thresholding algorithm in [21] and an adaptation of the iteratively reweighted
$\ell_1$ algorithm in [23, Algorithm 7] with nonmonotone line-search for
solving random instances of log penalty regularized least squares problems in

1134,Model comparison for Gibbs random fields using noisy reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo,"  The reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method offers an
across-model simulation approach for Bayesian estimation and model comparison,
by exploring the sampling space that consists of several models of possibly
varying dimensions. A naive implementation of RJMCMC to models like Gibbs
random fields suffers from computational difficulties: the posterior
distribution for each model is termed doubly-intractable since computation of
the likelihood function is rarely available. Consequently, it is simply
impossible to simulate a transition of the Markov chain in the presence of
likelihood intractability. A variant of RJMCMC is presented, called noisy
RJMCMC, where the underlying transition kernel is replaced with an
approximation based on unbiased estimators. Based on previous theoretical
developments, convergence guarantees for the noisy RJMCMC algorithm are
provided. The experiments show that the noisy RJMCMC algorithm can be much more
efficient than other exact methods, provided that an estimator with controlled
Monte Carlo variance is used, a fact which is in agreement with the theoretical
analysis.

1135,Nearly Optimal Robust Subspace Tracking,"  In this work, we study the robust subspace tracking (RST) problem and obtain
one of the first two provable guarantees for it. The goal of RST is to track
sequentially arriving data vectors that lie in a slowly changing
low-dimensional subspace, while being robust to corruption by additive sparse
outliers. It can also be interpreted as a dynamic (time-varying) extension of
robust PCA (RPCA), with the minor difference that RST also requires a short
tracking delay. We develop a recursive projected compressive sensing algorithm
that we call Nearly Optimal RST via ReProCS (ReProCS-NORST) because its
tracking delay is nearly optimal. We prove that NORST solves both the RST and
the dynamic RPCA problems under weakened standard RPCA assumptions, two simple
extra assumptions (slow subspace change and most outlier magnitudes lower
bounded), and a few minor assumptions.
Our guarantee shows that NORST enjoys a near optimal tracking delay of $O(r
\log n \log(1/\epsilon))$. Its required delay between subspace change times is
the same, and its memory complexity is $n$ times this value. Thus both these
are also nearly optimal. Here $n$ is the ambient space dimension, $r$ is the
subspaces' dimension, and $\epsilon$ is the tracking accuracy. NORST also has
the best outlier tolerance compared with all previous RPCA or RST methods, both
theoretically and empirically (including for real videos), without requiring
any model on how the outlier support is generated. This is possible because of
the extra assumptions it uses.

1136,The Social Bow Tie,"  Understanding tie strength in social networks, and the factors that influence
it, have received much attention in a myriad of disciplines for decades.
Several models incorporating indicators of tie strength have been proposed and
used to quantify relationships in social networks, and a standard set of
structural network metrics have been applied to predominantly online social
media sites to predict tie strength. Here, we introduce the concept of the
""social bow tie"" framework, a small subgraph of the network that consists of a
collection of nodes and ties that surround a tie of interest, forming a
topological structure that resembles a bow tie. We also define several
intuitive and interpretable metrics that quantify properties of the bow tie. We
use random forests and regression models to predict categorical and continuous
measures of tie strength from different properties of the bow tie, including
nodal attributes. We also investigate what aspects of the bow tie are most
predictive of tie strength in two distinct social networks: a collection of 75
rural villages in India and a nationwide call network of European mobile phone
users. Our results indicate several of the bow tie metrics are highly
predictive of tie strength, and we find the more the social circles of two
individuals overlap, the stronger their tie, consistent with previous findings.
However, we also find that the more tightly-knit their non-overlapping social
circles, the weaker the tie. This new finding complements our current
understanding of what drives the strength of ties in social networks.

1137,Crawling migration under chemical signalling: a stochastic particle model,"  Cell migration is a fundamental process involved in physiological phenomena
such as the immune response and morphogenesis, but also in pathological
processes, such as the development of tumor metastasis. These functions are
effectively ensured because cells are active systems that adapt to their
environment. In this work, we consider a migrating cell as an active particle,
where its intracellular activity is responsible for motion. Such system was
already modeled in a previous model where the protrusion activity of the cell
was described by a stochastic Markovian jump process. The model was proven able
to capture the diversity in observed trajectories. Here, we add a description
of the effect of an external chemical attractive signal on the protrusion
dynamics, that may vary in time. We show that the resulting stochastic model is
a well-posed non-homogeneous Markovian process, and provide cell trajectories
in different settings, illustrating the effects of the signal on long-term
trajectories.

1138,A Hierarchical Bayesian Linear Regression Model with Local Features for Stochastic Dynamics Approximation,"  One of the challenges in model-based control of stochastic dynamical systems
is that the state transition dynamics are involved, and it is not easy or
efficient to make good-quality predictions of the states. Moreover, there are
not many representational models for the majority of autonomous systems, as it
is not easy to build a compact model that captures the entire dynamical
subtleties and uncertainties. In this work, we present a hierarchical Bayesian
linear regression model with local features to learn the dynamics of a
micro-robotic system as well as two simpler examples, consisting of a
stochastic mass-spring damper and a stochastic double inverted pendulum on a
cart. The model is hierarchical since we assume non-stationary priors for the
model parameters. These non-stationary priors make the model more flexible by
imposing priors on the priors of the model. To solve the maximum likelihood
(ML) problem for this hierarchical model, we use the variational expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm, and enhance the procedure by introducing hidden
target variables. The algorithm yields parsimonious model structures, and
consistently provides fast and accurate predictions for all our examples
involving large training and test sets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
the method in learning stochastic dynamics, which makes it suitable for future
use in a paradigm, such as model-based reinforcement learning, to compute
optimal control policies in real time.

1139,Structurally Sparsified Backward Propagation for Faster Long Short-Term Memory Training,"  Exploiting sparsity enables hardware systems to run neural networks faster
and more energy-efficiently. However, most prior sparsity-centric optimization
techniques only accelerate the forward pass of neural networks and usually
require an even longer training process with iterative pruning and retraining.
We observe that artificially inducing sparsity in the gradients of the gates in
an LSTM cell has little impact on the training quality. Further, we can enforce
structured sparsity in the gate gradients to make the LSTM backward pass up to
45% faster than the state-of-the-art dense approach and 168% faster than the
state-of-the-art sparsifying method on modern GPUs. Though the structured
sparsifying method can impact the accuracy of a model, this performance gap can
be eliminated by mixing our sparse training method and the standard dense
training method. Experimental results show that the mixed method can achieve
comparable results in a shorter time span than using purely dense training.

with their shape. In this paper we propose a new algorithm named Linear DBSCAN
(Lin-DBSCAN), a simple approach to clustering inspired by the density model
introduced with the well known algorithm DBSCAN. Designed to minimize the
computational cost of density based clustering on geospatial data, Lin-DBSCAN
features a linear time complexity that makes it suitable for real-time
applications on low-resource devices. Lin-DBSCAN uses a discrete version of the
density model of DBSCAN that takes ad- vantage of a grid-based scan and merge
approach. The name of the algorithm stems exactly from its main features
outlined above. The algorithm was tested with well known data sets.
Experimental results prove the efficiency and the validity of this approach
over DBSCAN in the context of spatial data clustering, enabling the use of a
density-based clustering technique on large datasets with low computational
cost.

1142,Universal kinetics for engagement of mechanosensing pathways in cell adhesion,"  When plated onto substrates, cell morphology and even stem cell
differentiation are influenced by the stiffness of their environment. Stiffer
substrates give strongly spread (eventually polarized) cells with strong focal
adhesions, and stress fibers; very soft substrates give a less developed
cytoskeleton, and much lower cell spreading. The kinetics of this process of
cell spreading is studied extensively, and important universal relationships
are established on how the cell area grows with time. Here we study the
population dynamics of spreading cells, investigating the characteristic
processes involved in cell response to the substrate. We show that unlike the
individual cell morphology, this population dynamics does not depend on the
substrate stiffness. Instead, a strong activation temperature dependence is
observed. Different cell lines on different substrates all have long-time
statistics controlled by the thermal activation over a single energy barrier
dG=19 kcal/mol, while the early-time kinetics follows a power law $t^5$. This
implies that the rate of spreading depends on an internal process of
adhesion-mechanosensing complex assembly and activation: the operational
complex must have 5 component proteins, and the last process in the sequence
(which we believe is the activation of focal adhesion kinase) is controlled by
the binding energy dG.

1143,Maximizing acquisition functions for Bayesian optimization,"  Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient approach to global optimization
that relies on theoretically motivated value heuristics (acquisition functions)
to guide its search process. Fully maximizing acquisition functions produces
the Bayes' decision rule, but this ideal is difficult to achieve since these
functions are frequently non-trivial to optimize. This statement is especially
true when evaluating queries in parallel, where acquisition functions are
routinely non-convex, high-dimensional, and intractable. We first show that
acquisition functions estimated via Monte Carlo integration are consistently
amenable to gradient-based optimization. Subsequently, we identify a common
family of acquisition functions, including EI and UCB, whose properties not
only facilitate but justify use of greedy approaches for their maximization.

1144,Distributed Newton Methods for Deep Neural Networks,"  Deep learning involves a difficult non-convex optimization problem with a
large number of weights between any two adjacent layers of a deep structure. To
handle large data sets or complicated networks, distributed training is needed,
but the calculation of function, gradient, and Hessian is expensive. In
particular, the communication and the synchronization cost may become a
bottleneck. In this paper, we focus on situations where the model is
distributedly stored, and propose a novel distributed Newton method for
training deep neural networks. By variable and feature-wise data partitions,
and some careful designs, we are able to explicitly use the Jacobian matrix for
matrix-vector products in the Newton method. Some techniques are incorporated
to reduce the running time as well as the memory consumption. First, to reduce
the communication cost, we propose a diagonalization method such that an
approximate Newton direction can be obtained without communication between
machines. Second, we consider subsampled Gauss-Newton matrices for reducing the
running time as well as the communication cost. Third, to reduce the
synchronization cost, we terminate the process of finding an approximate Newton
direction even though some nodes have not finished their tasks. Details of some
implementation issues in distributed environments are thoroughly investigated.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for the
distributed training of deep neural networks. In compared with stochastic
gradient methods, it is more robust and may give better test accuracy.

1146,Confidence Intervals for Quantiles from Histograms and Other Grouped Data,"  Interval estimation of quantiles has been treated by many in the literature.
However, to the best of our knowledge there has been no consideration for
interval estimation when the data are available in grouped format. Motivated by
this, we introduce several methods to obtain confidence intervals for quantiles
when only grouped data is available. Our preferred method for interval
estimation is to approximate the underlying density using the Generalized
Lambda Distribution (GLD) to both estimate the quantiles and variance of the
quantile estimators. We compare the GLD method with some other methods that we
also introduce which are based on a frequency approximation approach and a
linear interpolation approximation of the density. Our methods are strongly
supported by simulations showing that excellent coverage can be achieved for a
wide number of distributions. These distributions include highly-skewed
distributions such as the log-normal, Dagum and Singh-Maddala distributions. We
also apply our methods to real data and show that inference can be carried out
on published outcomes that have been summarized only by a histogram. Our
methods are therefore useful for a broad range of applications. We have also
created a web application that can be used to conveniently calculate the
estimators.

1147,Supervised learning with quantum enhanced feature spaces,"  Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the
potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously
untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for
pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most
well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations
to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes
large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A
core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the
exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable
entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement
two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the
feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage
of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced
solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and
operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set
in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel
estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier
directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the
applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine
learning.

1148,Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics for Location Selection of Add-on Retail Products,"  In this paper, we study an analytical approach to selecting expansion
locations for retailers selling add-on products whose demand is derived from
the demand of another base product. Demand for the add-on product is realized
only as a supplement to the demand of the base product. In our context, either
of the two products could be subject to spatial autocorrelation where demand at
a given location is impacted by demand at other locations. Using data from an
industrial partner selling add-on products, we build predictive models for
understanding the derived demand of the add-on product and establish an
optimization framework for automating expansion decisions to maximize expected
sales. Interestingly, spatial autocorrelation and the complexity of the
predictive model impact the complexity and the structure of the prescriptive
optimization model. Our results indicate that the models formulated are highly
effective in predicting add-on product sales, and that using the optimization
framework built on the predictive model can result in substantial increases in
expected sales over baseline policies.

in data. In recent years, data as become increasingly higher dimensional and,
therefore, an increased need has arisen for dimension reduction techniques for
clustering. Although such techniques are firmly established in the literature
for multivariate data, there is a relative paucity in the area of matrix
variate or three way data. Furthermore, the few methods that are available all
assume matrix variate normality, which is not always sensible if cluster
skewness or excess kurtosis is present. Mixtures of bilinear factor analyzers
models using skewed matrix variate distributions are proposed. In all, four
such mixture models are presented, based on matrix variate skew-t, generalized
hyperbolic, variance gamma and normal inverse Gaussian distributions,

1152,Observable dictionary learning for high-dimensional statistical inference,"  This paper introduces a method for efficiently inferring a high-dimensional
distributed quantity from a few observations. The quantity of interest (QoI) is
approximated in a basis (dictionary) learned from a training set. The
coefficients associated with the approximation of the QoI in the basis are
determined by minimizing the misfit with the observations. To obtain a
probabilistic estimate of the quantity of interest, a Bayesian approach is
employed. The QoI is treated as a random field endowed with a hierarchical
prior distribution so that closed-form expressions can be obtained for the
posterior distribution. The main contribution of the present work lies in the
derivation of \emph{a representation basis consistent with the observation
chain} used to infer the associated coefficients. The resulting dictionary is
then tailored to be both observable by the sensors and accurate in
approximating the posterior mean. An algorithm for deriving such an observable
dictionary is presented. The method is illustrated with the estimation of the
velocity field of an open cavity flow from a handful of wall-mounted point
sensors. Comparison with standard estimation approaches relying on Principal
Component Analysis and K-SVD dictionaries is provided and illustrates the
superior performance of the present approach.

simple and effective measure of relative inequality for income data that is
resistant to outliers. It measures the average relative distance of a randomly
chosen income from its symmetric quantile. Another useful property of this
index is investigated here: given a partition of the income distribution into a
union of sets of symmetric quantiles, one can find the conditional inequality
for each set as measured by the quantile ratio index and readily combine them
in a weighted average to obtain the index for the entire population. When
applied to data for various years, one can track how these contributions to
inequality vary over time, as illustrated here for Australian Bureau of
Statistics income and wealth data.

1154,Disentangled VAE Representations for Multi-Aspect and Missing Data,"  Many problems in machine learning and related application areas are
fundamentally variants of conditional modeling and sampling across multi-aspect
data, either multi-view, multi-modal, or simply multi-group. For example,
sampling from the distribution of English sentences conditioned on a given
French sentence or sampling audio waveforms conditioned on a given piece of
text. Central to many of these problems is the issue of missing data: we can
observe many English, French, or German sentences individually but only
occasionally do we have data for a sentence pair. Motivated by these
applications and inspired by recent progress in variational autoencoders for
grouped data, we develop factVAE, a deep generative model capable of handling
multi-aspect data, robust to missing observations, and with a prior that
encourages disentanglement between the groups and the latent dimensions. The
effectiveness of factVAE is demonstrated on a variety of rich real-world
datasets, including motion capture poses and pictures of faces captured from
varying poses and perspectives.

models when the annotation of the samples is expensive. Yet most of the
existing sampling methods cannot be applied to large-scale problems, consuming
too much time for data processing. In this paper, we propose a fast active
learning algorithm for regression, tailored for neural network models. It is
based on uncertainty estimation from stochastic dropout output of the network.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show comparable or better
performance (depending on the accuracy metric) as compared to the baselines.
This approach can be generalized to other deep learning architectures. It can
be used to systematically improve a machine-learning model as it offers a
computationally efficient way of sampling additional data.

1156,Smooth Pinball Neural Network for Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power,"  Uncertainty analysis in the form of probabilistic forecasting can
significantly improve decision making processes in the smart power grid for
better integrating renewable energy sources such as wind. Whereas point
forecasting provides a single expected value, probabilistic forecasts provide
more information in the form of quantiles, prediction intervals, or full
predictive densities. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of a novel approach
for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power that combines a
smooth approximation of the pinball loss function with a neural network
architecture and a weighting initialization scheme to prevent the quantile
cross over problem. A numerical case study is conducted using publicly
available wind data from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014.
Multiple quantiles are estimated to form 10%, to 90% prediction intervals which
are evaluated using a quantile score and reliability measures. Benchmark models
such as the persistence and climatology distributions, multiple quantile
regression, and support vector quantile regression are used for comparison
where results demonstrate the proposed approach leads to improved performance
while preventing the problem of overlapping quantile estimates.

1157,Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks for Robustly Approximating Arbitrary Probability Distributions,"  We show that discrete distributions on the $d$-dimensional non-negative
integer lattice can be approximated arbitrarily well via the marginals of
stationary distributions for various classes of stochastic chemical reaction
networks. We begin by providing a class of detailed balanced networks and prove
that they can approximate any discrete distribution to any desired accuracy.
However, these detailed balanced constructions rely on the ability to
initialize a system precisely, and are therefore susceptible to perturbations
in the initial conditions. We therefore provide another construction based on
the ability to approximate point mass distributions and prove that this
construction is capable of approximating arbitrary discrete distributions for
any choice of initial condition. In particular, the developed models are
ergodic, so their limit distributions are robust to a finite number of
perturbations over time in the counts of molecules.

1158,Early Salient Region Selection Does Not Drive Rapid Visual Categorization,"  The current dominant visual processing paradigm in both human and machine
research is the feedforward, layered hierarchy of neural-like processing
elements. Within this paradigm, visual saliency is seen by many to have a
specific role, namely that of early selection. Early selection is thought to
enable very fast visual performance by limiting processing to only the most
relevant candidate portions of an image. Though this strategy has indeed led to
improved processing time efficiency in machine algorithms, at least one set of
critical tests of this idea has never been performed with respect to the role
of early selection in human vision. How would the best of the current saliency
models perform on the stimuli used by experimentalists who first provided
evidence for this visual processing paradigm? Would the algorithms really
provide correct candidate sub-images to enable fast categorization on those
same images? Here, we report on a new series of tests of these questions whose
results suggest that it is quite unlikely that such an early selection process
has any role in human rapid visual categorization.

1159,Are Bitcoin Bubbles Predictable? Combining a Generalized Metcalfe's Law and the LPPLS Model,"  We develop a strong diagnostic for bubbles and crashes in bitcoin, by
analyzing the coincidence (and its absence) of fundamental and technical
indicators. Using a generalized Metcalfe's law based on network properties, a
fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least
four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a
universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal
pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which
parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding
and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex-ante warning of market
instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the
crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the
precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel's back) being exogenous
and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but
not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of bitcoin, suggesting many months
of volatile sideways bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March

1160,Variational approach for learning Markov processes from time series data,"  Inference, prediction and control of complex dynamical systems from time
series is important in many areas, including financial markets, power grid
management, climate and weather modeling, or molecular dynamics. The analysis
of such highly nonlinear dynamical systems is facilitated by the fact that we
can often find a (generally nonlinear) transformation of the system coordinates
to features in which the dynamics can be excellently approximated by a linear
Markovian model. Moreover, the large number of system variables often change
collectively on large time- and length-scales, facilitating a low-dimensional
analysis in feature space. In this paper, we introduce a variational approach
for Markov processes (VAMP) that allows us to find optimal feature mappings and
optimal Markovian models of the dynamics from given time series data. The key
insight is that the best linear model can be obtained from the top singular
components of the Koopman operator. This leads to the definition of a family of
score functions called VAMP-r which can be calculated from data, and can be
employed to optimize a Markovian model. In addition, based on the relationship
between the variational scores and approximation errors of Koopman operators,
we propose a new VAMP-E score, which can be applied to cross-validation for
hyper-parameter optimization and model selection in VAMP. VAMP is valid for
both reversible and nonreversible processes and for stationary and
non-stationary processes or realizations.

reliable systems. Variational inference (VI) is a promising approach for such
computation, but requires more effort to implement and execute compared to
maximum-likelihood methods. In this paper, we propose new natural-gradient
algorithms to reduce such efforts for Gaussian mean-field VI. Our algorithms
can be implemented within the Adam optimizer by perturbing the network weights
during gradient evaluations, and uncertainty estimates can be cheaply obtained
by using the vector that adapts the learning rate. This requires lower memory,
computation, and implementation effort than existing VI methods, while
obtaining uncertainty estimates of comparable quality. Our empirical results
confirm this and further suggest that the weight-perturbation in our algorithm
could be useful for exploration in reinforcement learning and stochastic
optimization.

1162,Adversarial Attacks on Neural Networks for Graph Data,"  Deep learning models for graphs have achieved strong performance for the task
of node classification. Despite their proliferation, currently there is no
study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they
are likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning
models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study
of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models
exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we
tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus
on the training phase of a machine learning model. We generate adversarial
perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus,
taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that
the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data
characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an
efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our
experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly
drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are
transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node
classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful
even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given.

1163,Bagged Empirical Null p-values: A Method to Account for Model Uncertainty in Large Scale Inference,"  When conducting large scale inference, such as genome-wide association
studies or image analysis, nominal $p$-values are often adjusted to improve
control over the family-wise error rate (FWER). When the majority of tests are
null, procedures controlling the False discovery rate (Fdr) can be improved by
replacing the theoretical global null with its empirical estimate. However,
these other adjustment procedures remain sensitive to the working model
assumption. Here we propose two key ideas to improve inference in this space.
First, we propose $p$-values that are standardized to the empirical null
distribution (instead of the theoretical null). Second, we propose model
averaging $p$-values by bootstrap aggregation (Bagging) to account for model
uncertainty and selection procedures. The combination of these two key ideas
yields bagged empirical null $p$-values (BEN $p$-values) that often
dramatically alter the rank ordering of significant findings. Moreover, we find
that a multidimensional selection criteria based on BEN $p$-values and bagged
model fit statistics is more likely to yield reproducible findings. A
re-analysis of the famous Golub Leukemia data is presented to illustrate these
ideas. We uncovered new findings in these data, not detected previously, that
are backed by published bench work pre-dating the Gloub experiment. A
pseudo-simulation using the leukemia data is also presented to explore the
stability of this approach under broader conditions, and illustrates the
superiority of the BEN $p$-values compared to the other approaches.

financial domain provides unprecedented opportunities to understand the stock
market more comprehensively and makes the price prediction more accurate than
before. However, they also bring challenges to classic statistic approaches
since those models might be constrained to a certain type of data. Aiming at
aggregating differently sourced information and offering type-free capability
to existing models, a framework for predicting stock market of scenarios with
mixed data, including scalar data, compositional data (pie-like) and functional
data (curve-like), is established. The presented framework is
model-independent, as it serves like an interface to multiple types of data and
can be combined with various prediction models. And it is proved to be
effective through numerical simulations. Regarding to price prediction, we
incorporate the trading volume (scalar data), intraday return series
(functional data), and investors' emotions from social media (compositional
data) through the framework to competently forecast whether the market goes up
or down at opening in the next day. The strong explanatory power of the
framework is further demonstrated. Specifically, it is found that the intraday
returns impact the following opening prices differently between bearish market
and bullish market. And it is not at the beginning of the bearish market but
the subsequent period in which the investors' ""fear"" comes to be indicative.
The framework would help extend existing prediction models easily to scenarios
with multiple types of data and shed light on a more systemic understanding of
the stock market.

transportation systems in a smart city. An accurate prediction model can help
the city pre-allocate resources to meet travel demand and to reduce empty taxis
on streets which waste energy and worsen the traffic congestion. With the
increasing popularity of taxi requesting services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing
(in China), we are able to collect large-scale taxi demand data continuously.
How to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction is an interesting
and critical real-world problem. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly
rely on time series forecasting techniques, which fail to model the complex
non-linear spatial and temporal relations. Recent advances in deep learning
have shown superior performance on traditionally challenging tasks such as
image classification by learning the complex features and correlations from
large-scale data. This breakthrough has inspired researchers to explore deep
learning techniques on traffic prediction problems. However, existing methods
on traffic prediction have only considered spatial relation (e.g., using CNN)
or temporal relation (e.g., using LSTM) independently. We propose a Deep
Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network (DMVST-Net) framework to model both spatial
and temporal relations. Specifically, our proposed model consists of three
views: temporal view (modeling correlations between future demand values with
near time points via LSTM), spatial view (modeling local spatial correlation
via local CNN), and semantic view (modeling correlations among regions sharing
similar temporal patterns). Experiments on large-scale real taxi demand data
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.

people who are predisposed to common diseases, solving rare diseases, and

researchers to identify groups (i.e. clusters) of related variables, the
accuracy, and effectiveness of these methods diminish for large and
high-dimensional datasets such as the whole human genome. On the other hand,
deep neural network architectures (the core of deep learning) can better
exploit large-scale datasets to build complex models. In this paper, we use the
K-means clustering approach for scalable genomic data analysis aiming towards
clustering genotypic variants at the population scale. Finally, we train a deep
belief network (DBN) for predicting the geographic ethnicity. We used the
genotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project, which covers the result of genome
sequencing for 2504 individuals from 26 different ethnic origins and comprises

1168,Measuring and avoiding side effects using relative reachability,"  How can we design reinforcement learning agents that avoid causing
unnecessary disruptions to their environment? We argue that current approaches
to penalizing side effects can introduce bad incentives in tasks that require
irreversible actions, and in environments that contain sources of change other
than the agent. For example, some approaches give the agent an incentive to
prevent any irreversible changes in the environment, including the actions of
other agents. We introduce a general definition of side effects, based on
relative reachability of states compared to a default state, that avoids these
undesirable incentives. Using a set of gridworld experiments illustrating
relevant scenarios, we empirically compare relative reachability to penalties
based on existing definitions and show that it is the only penalty among those
tested that produces the desired behavior in all the scenarios.

present Neural State Classification (NSC) as an efficient solution technique.
SCP generalizes the model checking problem as it entails classifying each state
$s$ of a hybrid automaton as either positive or negative, depending on whether
or not $s$ satisfies a given time-bounded reachability specification. This is
an interesting problem in its own right, which NSC solves using
machine-learning techniques, Deep Neural Networks in particular. State
classifiers produced by NSC tend to be very efficient (run in constant time and
space), but may be subject to classification errors. To quantify and mitigate
such errors, our approach comprises: i) techniques for certifying, with
statistical guarantees, that an NSC classifier meets given accuracy levels; ii)
tuning techniques, including a novel technique based on adversarial sampling,
that can virtually eliminate false negatives (positive states classified as
negative), thereby making the classifier more conservative. We have applied NSC
to six nonlinear hybrid system benchmarks, achieving an accuracy of 99.25% to
99.98%, and a false-negative rate of 0.0033 to 0, which we further reduced to
0.0015 to 0 after tuning the classifier. We believe that this level of accuracy
is acceptable in many practical applications, and that these results
demonstrate the promise of the NSC approach.

teacher is a high-capacity model with formidable performance, while the student

student's compactness. %we desire a compact model with performance close to the
teacher's. We study KD from a new perspective: rather than compressing models,
we train students parameterized identically to their teachers. Surprisingly,
these {Born-Again Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly,
both on computer vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs

usually happens without any indication, this problem seriously affects the
fabrication process for many years. Previous studies suggested many different
approaches for monitoring and detecting the breakage of machine tools. However,
there still exists a big gap between academic experiments and the complex real
fabrication processes such as the high demands of real-time detections, the
difficulty in data acquisition and transmission. In this work, we use the
spindle current approach to detect the breakage of machine tools, which has the
high performance of real-time monitoring, low cost, and easy to install. We
analyze the features of the current of a milling machine spindle through tools
wearing processes, and then we predict the status of tool breakage by a
convolutional neural network(CNN). In addition, we use a BP neural network to
understand the reliability of the CNN. The results show that our CNN approach
can detect tool breakage with an accuracy of 93%, while the best performance of
BP is 80%.

1172,Continuous Learning in Single-Incremental-Task Scenarios,"  It was recently shown that architectural, regularization and rehearsal
strategies can be used to train deep models sequentially on a number of
disjoint tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, these
strategies are still unsatisfactory if the tasks are not disjoint but
constitute a single incremental task (e.g., class-incremental learning). In
this paper we point out the differences between multi-task and
single-incremental-task scenarios and show that well-known approaches such as
LWF, EWC and SI are not ideal for incremental task scenarios. A new approach,
denoted as AR1, combining architectural and regularization strategies is then
specifically proposed. AR1 overhead (in term of memory and computation) is very
small thus making it suitable for online learning. When tested on CORe50 and
iCIFAR-100, AR1 outperformed existing regularization strategies by a good
margin.

1173,Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effects in the Presence of Irregular Assignment Mechanisms,"  This paper provides a link between causal inference and machine learning
techniques - specifically, Classification and Regression Trees (CART) - in
observational studies where the receipt of the treatment is not randomized, but
the assignment to the treatment can be assumed to be randomized (irregular
assignment mechanism). The paper contributes to the growing applied machine
learning literature on causal inference, by proposing a modified version of the
Causal Tree (CT) algorithm to draw causal inference from an irregular
assignment mechanism. The proposed method is developed by merging the CT
approach with the instrumental variable framework to causal inference, hence
the name Causal Tree with Instrumental Variable (CT-IV). As compared to CT, the
main strength of CT-IV is that it can deal more efficiently with the
heterogeneity of causal effects, as demonstrated by a series of numerical
results obtained on synthetic data. Then, the proposed algorithm is used to
evaluate a public policy implemented by the Tuscan Regional Administration
(Italy), which aimed at easing the access to credit for small firms. In this
context, CT-IV breaks fresh ground for target-based policies, identifying
interesting heterogeneous causal effects.

from Zika virus outbreaks and plan for mitigation strategies to minimize
ongoing and future outbreaks, understanding important characteristics of Zika
outbreaks and how they vary across regions is a challenging and important
problem. We developed a mathematical model for the 2015 Zika virus outbreak
dynamics in Colombia, El Salvador, and Suriname. We fit the model to publicly
available data provided by the Pan American Health Organization, using
Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate parameter distributions and
provide uncertainty quantification. An important model input is the at-risk
susceptible population, which can vary with a number of factors including
climate, elevation, population density, and socio-economic status. We informed
this initial condition using the highest historically reported dengue incidence
modified by the probable dengue reporting rates in the chosen countries. The
model indicated that a country-level analysis was not appropriate for Colombia.
We then estimated the basic reproduction number, or the expected number of new
human infections arising from a single infected human, to range between 4 and 6
for El Salvador and Suriname with a median of 4.3 and 5.3, respectively. We
estimated the reporting rate to be around 16% in El Salvador and 18% in
Suriname with estimated total outbreak sizes of 73,395 and 21,647 people,
respectively. The uncertainty in parameter estimates highlights a need for
research and data collection that will better constrain parameter ranges.

fixed over time, have an important influence on the evolution of prices over
time. Potentially important features were identified using the websites and
whitepapers of cryptocurrencies with the largest userbases. These were assessed
using two datasets to enhance robustness: one with fourteen cryptocurrencies
beginning from 9 November 2017, and a subset with nine cryptocurrencies
starting 9 September 2016, both ending 6 March 2018. Separately analysing the
subset of cryptocurrencies raised the number of data points from 115 to 537,
and improved robustness to changes in relationships over time. Excluding USD
Tether, the results showed a positive association between different
cryptocurrencies that was statistically significant. Robust, strong positive
associations were observed for six cryptocurrencies where one was a fork of the
other; Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash was an exception. There was evidence for the
existence of a group of cryptocurrencies particularly associated with Cardano,
and a separate group correlated with Ethereum. The data was not consistent with
a token's functionality or creation mechanism being the dominant determinants
of the evolution of prices over time but did suggest that factors other than
speculation contributed to the price.

1176,Detecting Learning vs Memorization in Deep Neural Networks using Shared Structure Validation Sets,"  The roles played by learning and memorization represent an important topic in
deep learning research. Recent work on this subject has shown that the
optimization behavior of DNNs trained on shuffled labels is qualitatively
different from DNNs trained with real labels. Here, we propose a novel
permutation approach that can differentiate memorization from learning in deep
neural networks (DNNs) trained as usual (i.e., using the real labels to guide
the learning, rather than shuffled labels). The evaluation of weather the DNN
has learned and/or memorized, happens in a separate step where we compare the
predictive performance of a shallow classifier trained with the features
learned by the DNN, against multiple instances of the same classifier, trained
on the same input, but using shuffled labels as outputs. By evaluating these
shallow classifiers in validation sets that share structure with the training
set, we are able to tell apart learning from memorization. Application of our
permutation approach to multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural
networks trained on image data corroborated many findings from other groups.
Most importantly, our illustrations also uncovered interesting dynamic patterns
about how DNNs memorize over increasing numbers of training epochs, and support
the surprising result that DNNs are still able to learn, rather than only
memorize, when trained with pure Gaussian noise as input.

1177,Bias Correction For Paid Search In Media Mix Modeling,"  Evaluating the return on ad spend (ROAS), the causal effect of advertising on
sales, is critical to advertisers for understanding the performance of their
existing marketing strategy as well as how to improve and optimize it. Media
Mix Modeling (MMM) has been used as a convenient analytical tool to address the
problem using observational data. However it is well recognized that MMM
suffers from various fundamental challenges: data collection, model
specification and selection bias due to ad targeting, among others
\citep{chan2017,wolfe2016}.
In this paper, we study the challenge associated with measuring the impact of
search ads in MMM, namely the selection bias due to ad targeting. Using causal
diagrams of the search ad environment, we derive a statistically principled
method for bias correction based on the \textit{back-door} criterion
\citep{pearl2013causality}. We use case studies to show that the method
provides promising results by comparison with results from randomized
experiments. We also report a more complex case study where the advertiser had
spent on more than a dozen media channels but results from a randomized
experiment are not available. Both our theory and empirical studies suggest
that in some common, practical scenarios, one may be able to obtain an
approximately unbiased estimate of search ad ROAS.

Predictability is achieved via multiple layers of composite factors as opposed
to additive ones. Viewed in this way, asset pricing studies can be revisited
using multi-layer deep learners, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or
long-short-term-memory (LSTM) for time-series effects. State-of-the-art
algorithms including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), TensorFlow and dropout
design provide imple- mentation and efficient factor exploration. To illustrate
our methodology, we revisit the equity market risk premium dataset of Welch and
Goyal (2008). We find the existence of nonlinear factors which explain
predictability of returns, in particular at the extremes of the characteristic
space. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.

1179,Limits to Arbitrage in Markets with Stochastic Settlement Latency,"  Distributed ledger technologies rely on consensus protocols confronting
traders with random waiting times until the transfer of ownership is
accomplished. This time-consuming settlement process exposes arbitrageurs to
price risk and imposes limits to arbitrage. We derive theoretical arbitrage
boundaries under general assumptions and show that they increase with expected
latency, latency uncertainty, spot volatility, and risk aversion. Using
high-frequency data from the Bitcoin network, we estimate arbitrage boundaries
due to settlement latency of on average 124 basis points, covering 88 percent
of the observed cross-exchange price differences. Settlement through
decentralized systems thus induces non-trivial frictions affecting market
efficiency and price formation.

Monte Carlo approach and becomes substantially more efficient when the
underlying asset has high volatility, while it performs better than multilevel
Monte Carlo for special cases of barrier options and underlying assets. These
theoretical findings are confirmed by numerous simulation results.

1181,On the Performance of a Canonical Labeling for Matching Correlated ErdÃ…â€˜s-RÃƒÂ©nyi Graphs,"  Graph matching in two correlated random graphs refers to the task of
identifying the correspondence between vertex sets of the graphs. Recent
results have characterized the exact information-theoretic threshold for graph
matching in correlated ErdÃ…â€˜s-RÃƒÂ©nyi graphs. However, very little is known
about the existence of efficient algorithms to achieve graph matching without
seeds. In this work we identify a region in which a straightforward $O(n^2\log
n)$-time canonical labeling algorithm, initially introduced in the context of
graph isomorphism, succeeds in matching correlated ErdÃ…â€˜s-RÃƒÂ©nyi graphs.
The algorithm has two steps. In the first step, all vertices are labeled by
their degrees and a trivial minimum distance matching (i.e., simply sorting
vertices according to their degrees) matches a fixed number of highest degree
vertices in the two graphs. Having identified this subset of vertices, the
remaining vertices are matched using a matching algorithm for bipartite graphs.

1182,On semi-supervised learning,"  Semi-supervised learning deals with the problem of how, if possible, to take
advantage of a huge amount of unclassified data, to perform a classification in
situations when, typically, there is little labeled data. Even though this is
not always possible (it depends on how useful, for inferring the labels, it
would be to know the distribution of the unlabeled data), several algorithm
have been proposed recently. %but in general they are not proved to outperform
A new algorithm is proposed, that under almost necessary conditions, %and it is
proved that it attains asymptotically the performance of the best theoretical
rule as the amount of unlabeled data tends to infinity. The set of necessary
assumptions, although reasonable, show that semi-supervised classification only
works for very well conditioned problems. The focus is on understanding when
and why semi-supervised learning works when the size of the initial training
sample remains fixed and the asymptotic is on the size of the unlabeled data.
The performance of the algorithm is assessed in the well known ""Isolet""
real-data of phonemes, where a strong dependence on the choice of the initial
training sample is shown.

and time series analysis. Important contributions to methodology, theory and
application for the prediction of future trajectories and the estimation of
functional time series parameters have been made in the recent past. This paper
continues this line of research by proposing a first principled approach to
estimate invertible functional time series by fitting functional moving average
processes. The idea is to estimate the coefficient operators in a functional
linear filter. To do this a functional Innovations Algorithm is utilized as a
starting point to estimate the corresponding moving average operators via
suitable projections into principal directions. In order to establish
consistency of the proposed estimators, asymptotic theory is developed for
increasing subspaces of these principal directions. For practical purposes,
several strategies to select the number of principal directions to include in
the estimation procedure as well as the choice of order of the functional
moving average process are discussed. Their empirical performance is evaluated
through simulations and an application to vehicle traffic data.

1185,Flexible Deep Neural Network Processing,"  The recent success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has drastically improved
the state of the art for many application domains. While achieving high
accuracy performance, deploying state-of-the-art DNNs is a challenge since they
typically require billions of expensive arithmetic computations. In addition,
DNNs are typically deployed in ensemble to boost accuracy performance, which
further exacerbates the system requirements. This computational overhead is an
issue for many platforms, e.g. data centers and embedded systems, with tight
latency and energy budgets. In this article, we introduce flexible DNNs
ensemble processing technique, which achieves large reduction in average
inference latency while incurring small to negligible accuracy drop. Our
technique is flexible in that it allows for dynamic adaptation between quality
of results (QoR) and execution runtime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
technique on AlexNet and ResNet-50 using the ImageNet dataset. This technique
can also easily handle other types of networks.

1187,A Copula-based Imputation Model for Missing Data of Mixed Type in Multilevel Data Sets,"  We propose a copula based method to handle missing values in multivariate
data of mixed types in multilevel data sets. Building upon the extended rank
likelihood of \cite{hoff2007extending} and the multinomial probit model, our
model is a latent variable model which is able to capture the relationship
among variables of different types as well as accounting for the clustering
structure. We fit the model by approximating the posterior distribution of the
parameters and the missing values through a Gibbs sampling scheme. We use the
multiple imputation procedure to incorporate the uncertainty due to missing
values in the analysis of the data. Our proposed method is evaluated through
simulations to compare it with several conventional methods of handling missing
data. We also apply our method to a data set from a cluster randomized
controlled trial of a multidisciplinary intervention in acute stroke units. We
conclude that our proposed copula based imputation model for mixed type
variables achieves reasonably good imputation accuracy and recovery of
parameters in some models of interest, and that adding random effects enhances
performance when the clustering effect is strong.

graph-structured data, including social network, protein-interaction network,
the world wide web data, knowledge graph, etc. While convolutional neural
network (CNN) facilitates great advances in gridded image/video understanding
tasks, very limited attention has been devoted to transform these successful
network structures (including Inception net, Residual net, Dense net, etc.) to
establish convolutional networks on graph, due to its irregularity and
complexity geometric topologies (unordered vertices, unfixed number of adjacent
edges/vertices). In this paper, we aim to give a comprehensive analysis of when
work matters by transforming different classical network structures to graph
CNN, particularly in the basic graph recognition problem. Specifically, we
firstly review the general graph CNN methods, especially in its spectral
filtering operation on the irregular graph data. We then introduce the basic
structures of ResNet, Inception and DenseNet into graph CNN and construct these
network structures on graph, named as G_ResNet, G_Inception, G_DenseNet. In
particular, it seeks to help graph CNNs by shedding light on how these
classical network structures work and providing guidelines for choosing
appropriate graph network frameworks. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate the
performance of these different network structures on several public graph
datasets (including social networks and bioinformatic datasets), and
demonstrate how different network structures work on graph CNN in the graph
recognition task.

competitive compression rates can be achieved by using a version of soft
weight-sharing (Nowlan & Hinton, 1992). Our method achieves both quantization
and pruning in one simple (re-)training procedure. This point of view also
exposes the relation between compression and the minimum description length

the modulation of neural activity. Yet, the degree to which brain activity and
functional connectivity during learning is constrained across subjects, for
example by conserved anatomy and physiology or by the nature of the task,
remains unknown. Here, we measured brain activity and functional connectivity
in a longitudinal experiment in which healthy adult human participants learned
the values of novel objects over the course of four days. We assessed the
presence of constraints on activity and functional connectivity using an
inter-subject correlation approach. Constraints on activity and connectivity
were greater in magnitude than expected in a non-parametric permutation-based
null model, particularly in primary sensory and motor systems, as well as in
regions associated with the learning of value. Notably, inter-subject
connectivity in activity and connectivity displayed marked temporal variations,
with inter-subject correlations in activity exceeding those in connectivity
during early learning and \emph{visa versa} in later learning. Finally,
individual differences in performance accuracy tracked the degree to which a
subject's connectivity, but not activity, tracked subject-general patterns.
Taken together, our results support the notion that brain activity and
connectivity are constrained across subjects in early learning, with
constraints on activity, but not connectivity, decreasing in later learning.

drive the tail risk dynamics, as a potentially more efficient driver than daily

the at-the-money implied volatility (ATMI) in terms of the Malliavin

short-term behavior of the ATMI of VIX and realized variance options in terms
of the Hurst parameter of the model, and most importantly we describe the class
of volatility processes that generate a positive skew for the VIX implied
volatility. In addition, we find that our ATMI asymptotic formulae perform very

such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

preserving an HD relationship between observations. Traditional biplots assign
meaning to the LD space of a PCA projection by displaying LD axes for the

PCA. MDS projections, which allow for arbitrary stress and dissimilarity
functions, require special care when labeling the LD space. We propose an

1196,Bias correction in daily maximum and minimum temperature measurements through Gaussian process modeling,"  The Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily database contains, among
other variables, daily maximum and minimum temperatures from weather stations
around the globe. It is long known that climatological summary statistics based
on daily temperature minima and maxima will not be accurate, if the bias due to
the time at which the observations were collected is not accounted for. Despite
some previous work, to our knowledge, there does not exist a satisfactory
solution to this important problem. In this paper, we carefully detail the
problem and develop a novel approach to address it. Our idea is to impute the
hourly temperatures at the location of the measurements by borrowing
information from the nearby stations that record hourly temperatures, which
then can be used to create accurate summaries of temperature extremes. The key
difficulty is that these imputations of the temperature curves must satisfy the
constraint of falling between the observed daily minima and maxima, and
attaining those values at least once in a twenty-four hour period. We develop a
spatiotemporal Gaussian process model for imputing the hourly measurements from
the nearby stations, and then develop a novel and easy to implement Markov
Chain Monte Carlo technique to sample from the posterior distribution
satisfying the above constraints. We validate our imputation model using hourly
temperature data from four meteorological stations in Iowa, of which one is
hidden and the data replaced with daily minima and maxima, and show that the
imputed temperatures recover the hidden temperatures well. We also demonstrate
that our model can exploit information contained in the data to infer the time
of daily measurements.

1197,DAGs with NO TEARS: Continuous Optimization for Structure Learning,"  Estimating the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs, also known as
Bayesian networks) is a challenging problem since the search space of DAGs is
combinatorial and scales superexponentially with the number of nodes. Existing
approaches rely on various local heuristics for enforcing the acyclicity
constraint. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different strategy: We
formulate the structure learning problem as a purely \emph{continuous}
optimization problem over real matrices that avoids this combinatorial
constraint entirely. This is achieved by a novel characterization of acyclicity
that is not only smooth but also exact. The resulting problem can be
efficiently solved by standard numerical algorithms, which also makes
implementation effortless. The proposed method outperforms existing ones,
without imposing any structural assumptions on the graph such as bounded
treewidth or in-degree. Code implementing the proposed algorithm is open-source

debate. The commonly-accepted persistence length of $l_p \approx 500\,$\AA\ is
inconsistent with recent studies on short-chain DNA that show much greater
flexibility but do not probe its origin. We have performed X-ray and neutron
small-angle scattering on a short DNA sequence containing a strong nucleosome
positioning element, and analyzed the results using a modified Kratky-Porod
model to determine possible conformations. Our results support a hypothesis
from Crick and Klug in 1975 that some DNA sequences in solution can have sharp
kinks, potentially resolving the discrepancy. Our conclusions are supported by
measurements on a radiation-damaged sample, where single-strand breaks lead to
increased flexibility and by an analysis of data from another sequence, which
does not have kinks, but where our method can detect a locally enhanced
flexibility due to an $AT$-domain.

threat to the public health. The increasing resistance of S.aureus to various
antibiotics has drawn it to a prime focus for research on designing an
appropriate drug delivery system. Emergence of Methicillin Resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 1961, necessitated the use of vancomycin ""the
drug of last resort"" to treat these infections. Unfortunately, S.aureus has
already started gaining resistances to vancomycin. Liposome encapsulation of
drugs have been earlier shown to provide an efficient method of microbial
inhibition in many cases. We have studied the effect of liposome encapsulated
vancomycin on MRSA and evaluated the antibacterial activity of the
liposome-entrapped drug in comparison to that of the free drug based on the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug. The MIC for liposomal
vancomycin was found to be about half of that of free vancomycin. The growth
response of MRSA showed that the liposomal vancomycin induced the culture to go
into bacteriostatic state and phagocytic killing was enhanced. Administration
of the antibiotic encapsulated in liposome thus was shown to greatly improve
the drug delivery as well as the drug resistance caused by MRSA.

directly affects the therapeutic options. We focus on triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) which has the worst prognosis among breast cancer types. Using
cutting edge methods from the field of robust statistics, we analyze Breast
Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) transcriptomic data publicly available from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Our analysis identifies statistical
outliers that may correspond to misdiagnosed patients. Furthermore, it is
illustrated that classical statistical methods may fail in the presence of
these outliers, prompting the need for robust statistics. Using robust sparse
logistic regression we obtain 36 relevant genes, of which ca. 60\% have been
previously reported as biologically relevant to TNBC, reinforcing the validity
of the method. The remaining 14 genes identified are new potential biomarkers
for TNBC. Out of these, JAM3, SFT2D2 and PAPSS1 were previously associated to
breast tumors or other types of cancer. The relevance of these genes is
confirmed by the new DetectDeviatingCells (DDC) outlier detection technique. A
comparison of gene networks on the selected genes showed significant
differences between TNBC and non-TNBC data. The individual role of FOXA1 in
TNBC and non-TNBC, and the strong FOXA1-AGR2 connection in TNBC stand out. Not
only will our results contribute to the breast cancer/TNBC understanding and
ultimately its management, they also show that robust regression and outlier
detection constitute key strategies to cope with high-dimensional clinical data

as deep learning, which achieves high performance mainly in image recognition
and speech recognition, has attracted attention in the machine learning field.
This paper implements deep learning to predict one-month-ahead stock returns in
the cross-section in the Japanese stock market and investigates the performance
of the method. Our results show that deep neural networks generally outperform
shallow neural networks, and the best networks also outperform representative
machine learning models. These results indicate that deep learning shows
promise as a skillful machine learning method to predict stock returns in the
cross-section.

1203,Dimension-free Information Concentration via Exp-Concavity,"  Information concentration of probability measures have important implications
in learning theory. Recently, it is discovered that the information content of
a log-concave distribution concentrates around their differential entropy,
albeit with an unpleasant dependence on the ambient dimension. In this work, we
prove that if the potentials of the log-concave distribution are exp-concave,
which is a central notion for fast rates in online and statistical learning,
then the concentration of information can be further improved to depend only on
the exp-concavity parameter, and hence, it can be dimension independent.
Central to our proof is a novel yet simple application of the variance
Brascamp-Lieb inequality. In the context of learning theory, our
concentration-of-information result immediately implies high-probability
results to many of the previous bounds that only hold in expectation.

1204,Improved Bayesian Compression,"  Compression of Neural Networks (NN) has become a highly studied topic in
recent years. The main reason for this is the demand for industrial scale usage
of NNs such as deploying them on mobile devices, storing them efficiently,
transmitting them via band-limited channels and most importantly doing
inference at scale. In this work, we propose to join the Soft-Weight Sharing
and Variational Dropout approaches that show strong results to define a new
state-of-the-art in terms of model compression.

1205,Interactions mediated by a public good transiently increase cooperativity in growing Pseudomonas putida metapopulations,"  Bacterial communities have rich social lives. A well-established interaction
involves the exchange of a public good in Pseudomonas populations, where the
iron-scavenging compound pyoverdine, synthesized by some cells, is shared with
the rest. Pyoverdine thus mediates interactions between producers and
non-producers and can constitute a public good. This interaction is often used
to test game theoretical predictions on the ""social dilemma"" of producers. Such
an approach, however, underestimates the impact of specific properties of the
public good, for example consequences of its accumulation in the environment.
Here, we experimentally quantify costs and benefits of pyoverdine production in
a specific environment, and build a model of population dynamics that
explicitly accounts for the changing significance of accumulating pyoverdine as
chemical mediator of social interactions. The model predicts that, in an
ensemble of growing populations (metapopulation) with different initial
producer fractions (and consequently pyoverdine contents), the global producer
fraction initially increases. Because the benefit of pyoverdine declines at
saturating concentrations, the increase need only be transient. Confirmed by
experiments on metapopulations, our results show how a changing benefit of a
public good can shape social interactions in a bacterial population.

1206,Assessing the state of e-Readiness for Small and Medium Companies in Mexico: a Proposed Taxonomy and Adoption Model,"  Emerging economies frequently show a large component of their Gross Domestic
Product to be dependant on the economic activity of small and medium
enterprises. Nevertheless, e-business solutions are more likely designed for
large companies. SMEs seem to follow a classical family-based management, used
to traditional activities, rather than seeking new ways of adding value to
their business strategy. Thus, a large portion of a nations economy may be at
disadvantage for competition. This paper aims at assessing the state of
e-business readiness of Mexican SMEs based on already published e-business
evolution models and by means of a survey research design. Data is being
collected in three cities with differing sizes and infrastructure conditions.
Statistical results are expected to be presented. A second part of this
research aims at applying classical adoption models to suggest potential causal
relationships, as well as more suitable recommendations for development.

1207,Data Augmentation for Robust Keyword Spotting under Playback Interference,"  Accurate on-device keyword spotting (KWS) with low false accept and false
reject rate is crucial to customer experience for far-field voice control of
conversational agents. It is particularly challenging to maintain low false
reject rate in real world conditions where there is (a) ambient noise from
external sources such as TV, household appliances, or other speech that is not
directed at the device (b) imperfect cancellation of the audio playback from
the device, resulting in residual echo, after being processed by the Acoustic
Echo Cancellation (AEC) system. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation
strategy to improve keyword spotting performance under these challenging
conditions. The training set audio is artificially corrupted by mixing in music
and TV/movie audio, at different signal to interference ratios. Our results
show that we get around 30-45% relative reduction in false reject rates, at a
range of false alarm rates, under audio playback from such devices.

1208,Heterogeneous inputs to central pattern generators can shape insect gaits,"  In our previous work, we studied an interconnected bursting neuron model for
insect locomotion, and its corresponding phase oscillator model, which at high
speed can generate stable tripod gaits with three legs off the ground
simultaneously in swing, and at low speed can generate stable tetrapod gaits
with two legs off the ground simultaneously in swing. However, at low speed
several other stable locomotion patterns, that are not typically observed as
insect gaits, may coexist. In the present paper, by adding heterogeneous
external input to each oscillator, we modify the bursting neuron model so that
its corresponding phase oscillator model produces only one stable gait at each
speed, specifically: a unique stable tetrapod gait at low speed, a unique
stable tripod gait at high speed, and a unique branch of stable transition
gaits connecting them. This suggests that control signals originating in the
brain and central nervous system can modify gait patterns.

1209,Portfolio Construction Matters,"  The role of portfolio construction in the implementation of equity market
neutral factors is often underestimated. Taking the classical momentum strategy
as an example, we show that one can significantly improve the main strategy's
features by properly taking care of this key step. More precisely, an optimized
portfolio construction algorithm allows one to significantly improve the Sharpe
Ratio, reduce sector exposures and volatility fluctuations, and mitigate the
strategy's skewness and tail correlation with the market. These results are
supported by long-term, world-wide simulations and will be shown to be
universal. Our findings are quite general and hold true for a number of other
""equity factors"". Finally, we discuss the details of a more realistic set-up
where we also deal with transaction costs.

statistical theory and small sample performance are introduced via this paper
and further upgraded to our new class of best one-sided cross-validation. Best
one-sided cross-validation turns out to have excellent performance in its

1211,VEEGAN: Reducing Mode Collapse in GANs using Implicit Variational Learning,"  Deep generative models provide powerful tools for distributions over
complicated manifolds, such as those of natural images. But many of these
methods, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), can be difficult to
train, in part because they are prone to mode collapse, which means that they
characterize only a few modes of the true distribution. To address this, we
introduce VEEGAN, which features a reconstructor network, reversing the action
of the generator by mapping from data to noise. Our training objective retains
the original asymptotic consistency guarantee of GANs, and can be interpreted
as a novel autoencoder loss over the noise. In sharp contrast to a traditional
autoencoder over data points, VEEGAN does not require specifying a loss
function over the data, but rather only over the representations, which are
standard normal by assumption. On an extensive set of synthetic and real world
image datasets, VEEGAN indeed resists mode collapsing to a far greater extent
than other recent GAN variants, and produces more realistic samples.

(Pelham et al., 1992) was translated and adopted for assessment of childhood
behavioral abnormalities, especially ADHD, ODD and CD in Georgian children and
adolescents. The DBD rating scale was translated into Georgian language using
back translation technique by English language philologists and checked and
corrected by qualified psychologists and psychiatrist of Georgia. Children and
adolescents in the age range of 6 to 16 years (N 290; Mean Age 10.50, SD=2.88)
including 153 males (Mean Age 10.42, SD= 2.62) and 141 females (Mean Age 10.60,
SD=3.14) were recruited from different public schools of Tbilisi and the
Neurology Department of the Pediatric Clinic of the Tbilisi State Medical
University. Participants objectively were assessed via interviewing
parents/teachers and qualified psychologists in three different settings
including school, home and clinic. In terms of DBD total scores revealed
statistically significant differences between healthy controls (M=27.71,
SD=17.26) and children and adolescents with ADHD (M=61.51, SD= 22.79).
Statistically significant differences were found for inattentive subtype
between control (M=8.68, SD=5.68) and ADHD (M=18.15, SD=6.57) groups. In
general it was shown that children and adolescents with ADHD had high score on
DBD in comparison to typically developed persons. In the study also was
determined gender wise prevalence in children and adolescents with ADHD, ODD
and CD. The research revealed prevalence of males in comparison with females in

1213,Towards Neural Co-Processors for the Brain: Combining Decoding and Encoding in Brain-Computer Interfaces,"  The field of brain-computer interfaces is poised to advance from the
traditional goal of controlling prosthetic devices using brain signals to
combining neural decoding and encoding within a single neuroprosthetic device.
Such a device acts as a ""co-processor"" for the brain, with applications ranging
from inducing Hebbian plasticity for rehabilitation after brain injury to
reanimating paralyzed limbs and enhancing memory. We review recent progress in
simultaneous decoding and encoding for closed-loop control and plasticity
induction. To address the challenge of multi-channel decoding and encoding, we
introduce a unifying framework for developing brain co-processors based on
artificial neural networks and deep learning. These ""neural co-processors"" can
be used to jointly optimize cost functions with the nervous system to achieve
desired behaviors ranging from targeted neuro-rehabilitation to augmentation of
brain function.

machine learning workflows. We present novel compact fixed-size vectorial
representations of PDs based on clustering and bag of words encodings that cope
well with the inherent sparsity of PDs. Our novel representations outperform
state-of-the-art approaches from topological data analysis and are

1215,Tonic activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors decreases intrinsic excitability and promotes bistability in a model of neuronal activity,"  NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) typically contribute to excitatory synaptic
transmission in the central nervous system. While calcium influx through NMDA-R
plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, indirect experimental evidence
also exists demonstrating actions of NMDAR-mediated calcium influx on neuronal
excitability through the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels.
But, so far, this mechanism has not been studied theoretically. Our theoretical
model provide a simple description of neuronal electrical activity including
the tonic activity of NMDA receptors and a cytosolic calcium compartment. We
show that calcium influx through NMDA-R can directly be coupled to activation
of calcium-activated potassium channels providing an overall inhibitory effect
on neuronal excitability. Furthermore, the presence of tonic NMDA-R activity
promotes bistability in electrical activity by dramatically increasing the
stimulus interval where both a stable steady state and repetitive firing can
exist. This results could provide an intrinsic mechanism for the constitution
of memory traces in neuronal circuits. They also shed light on the way by which
beta-amyloids can decrease neuronal activity when interfering with NMDA-R in
Alzheimer's disease.

Learning this paper proposes a modified architecture that produces more robust

Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm where the total input
dimensionality is halved by dividing the input into two independent streams. We
use ViZDoom, 3D world software that is based on the classical first person
shooter video game, Doom, as a test case. The experiments show that in
comparison to single input agents, the proposed architecture succeeds to have
the same playing performance and shows more robust behavior, achieving
significant reduction in the number of training parameters of almost 30%.

1217,A Biologically Plausible Supervised Learning Method for Spiking Neural Networks Using the Symmetric STDP Rule,"  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) possess energy-efficient potential due to
event-based computation. However, supervised training of SNNs remains a
challenge as spike activities are non-differentiable. Previous SNNs training
methods can basically be categorized into two classes, backpropagation-like
training methods and plasticity-based learning methods. The former methods are
dependent on energy-inefficient real-valued computation and non-local
transmission, as also required in artificial neural networks (ANNs), while the
latter either be considered biologically implausible or exhibit poor
performance. Hence, biologically plausible (bio-plausible) high-performance
supervised learning (SL) methods for SNNs remain deficient. In this paper, we
proposed a novel bio-plausible SNN model for SL based on the symmetric
spike-timing dependent plasticity (sym-STDP) rule found in neuroscience. By
combining the sym-STDP rule with bio-plausible synaptic scaling and intrinsic
plasticity of the dynamic threshold, our SNN model implemented SL well and
achieved good performance in the benchmark recognition task (MNIST). To reveal
the underlying mechanism of our SL model, we visualized both layer-based
activities and synaptic weights using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE) method after training and found that they were well
clustered, thereby demonstrating excellent classification ability. As the
learning rules were bio-plausible and based purely on local spike events, our
model could be easily applied to neuromorphic hardware for online training and
may be helpful for understanding SL information processing at the synaptic
level in biological neural systems.

1218,Gradient Masking Causes CLEVER to Overestimate Adversarial Perturbation Size,"  A key problem in research on adversarial examples is that vulnerability to
adversarial examples is usually measured by running attack algorithms. Because
the attack algorithms are not optimal, the attack algorithms are prone to
overestimating the size of perturbation needed to fool the target model. In
other words, the attack-based methodology provides an upper-bound on the size
of a perturbation that will fool the model, but security guarantees require a
lower bound. CLEVER is a proposed scoring method to estimate a lower bound.
Unfortunately, an estimate of a bound is not a bound. In this report, we show
that gradient masking, a common problem that causes attack methodologies to
provide only a very loose upper bound, causes CLEVER to overestimate the size
of perturbation needed to fool the model. In other words, CLEVER does not
resolve the key problem with the attack-based methodology, because it fails to
provide a lower bound.

1219,Gaussian process regression for forest attribute estimation from airborne laser scanning data,"  While the analysis of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data often provides
reliable estimates for certain forest stand attributes -- such as total volume
or basal area -- there is still room for improvement, especially in estimating
species-specific attributes. Moreover, while information on the estimate
uncertainty would be useful in various economic and environmental analyses on
forests, a computationally feasible framework for uncertainty quantifying in
ALS is still missing. In this article, the species-specific stand attribute
estimation and uncertainty quantification (UQ) is approached using Gaussian
process regression (GPR), which is a nonlinear and nonparametric machine
learning method. Multiple species-specific stand attributes are estimated
simultaneously: tree height, stem diameter, stem number, basal area, and stem
volume. The cross-validation results show that GPR yields on average an
improvement of 4.6\% in estimate RMSE over a state-of-the-art k-nearest
neighbors (kNN) implementation, negligible bias and well performing UQ
(credible intervals), while being computationally fast. The performance
advantage over kNN and the feasibility of credible intervals persists even when
smaller training sets are used.

1221,Rapid micro fluorescence in situ hybridization in tissue sections,"  This paper describes a micro fluorescence in situ hybridization
({\mu}FISH)-based rapid detection of cytogenetic biomarkers on formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. We demonstrated this method in the
context of detecting human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) in breast tissue
sections. This method uses a non-contact microfluidic scanning probe (MFP),
which localizes FISH probes at the micrometer length-scale to selected cells of
the tissue section. The scanning ability of the MFP allows for a versatile
implementation of FISH on tissue sections. We demonstrated the use of
oligonucleotide FISH probes in ethylene carbonate-based buffer enabling rapid
hybridization within < 1 min for chromosome enumeration and 10-15 min for
assessment of the HER2 status in FFPE sections. We further demonstrated
recycling of FISH probes for multiple sequential tests using a defined volume
of probes by forming hierarchical hydrodynamic flow confinements. This
microscale method is compatible with the standard FISH protocols and with the
Instant Quality (IQ) FISH assay, reduces the FISH probe consumption ~100-fold
and the hybridization time 4-fold, resulting in an assay turnaround time of < 3
h. We believe rapid {\mu}FISH has the potential of being used in pathology
workflows as a standalone method or in combination with other molecular methods
for diagnostic and prognostic analysis of FFPE sections.

cancer cells near the peripheral nerves. The interference of tissue-resident
immune cells does not allow a direct contact with nerve fibres which affects
the tumor microenvironment and the invasion process. Methods. Anaplastic
tumor-1 (AT-1) cells were inoculated within the sciatic nerves (SNs) of male
Copenhagen rats. Lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the SNs were collected
on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. SN tissues were examined for morphological changes
and DRG tissues for immunofluorescence, electrophoretic tendency, and mRNA
quantification. Hypersensitivities to cold, mechanical, and thermal stimuli
were determined. HC-030031, a selective TRPA1 antagonist, was used to treat
cold allodynia. Results. Nociception thresholds were identified on day 6.
Immunofluorescent micrographs showed overexpression of TRPA1 on days 7 and 14
and of CGRP on day 14 until day 21. Both TRPA1 and CGRP were coexpressed on the
same cells. Immunoblots exhibited an increase in TRPA1 expression on day 14.
TRPA1 mRNA underwent an increase on day 7 (normalized to 18S). Injection of
HC-030031 transiently reversed the cold allodynia. Conclusion. A novel and a
promising model of cancer-induced neuropathy was established, and the role of
TRPA1 and CGRP in pain transduction was examined.

surface EEG, ECoG and {\mu}ECoG, and therefore plays an important role in many
research and clinical applications. Deep learning with artificial neural
networks has recently seen increasing attention as a new approach in brain
signal decoding. Here, we apply a deep learning approach using convolutional
neural networks to {\mu}ECoG data obtained with a wireless, chronically
implanted system in an ovine animal model. Regularized linear discriminant
analysis (rLDA), a filter bank component spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm and
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) were applied to auditory evoked
responses captured by {\mu}ECoG. We show that compared with rLDA and FBCSP,
significantly higher decoding accuracy can be obtained by ConvNets trained in
an end-to-end manner, i.e., without any predefined signal features. Deep
learning thus proves a promising technique for {\mu}ECoG-based brain-machine
interfacing applications.

1224,Jensen's force and the statistical mechanics of cortical asynchronous states,"  The cortex exhibits self-sustained highly-irregular activity even under
resting conditions, whose origin and function need to be fully understood. It
is believed that this can be described as an ""asynchronous state"" stemming from
the balance between excitation and inhibition, with important consequences for
information-processing, though a competing hypothesis claims it stems from
critical dynamics. By analyzing a parsimonious neural-network model with
excitatory and inhibitory interactions, we elucidate a noise-induced mechanism
called ""Jensen's force"" responsible for the emergence of a novel phase of
arbitrarily-low but self-sustained activity, which reproduces all the
experimental features of asynchronous states. The simplicity of our framework
allows for a deep understanding of asynchronous states from a broad
statistical-mechanics perspective and of the phase transitions to other
standard phases it exhibits, opening the door to reconcile, asynchronous-state
and critical-state hypotheses. We argue that Jensen's forces are measurable
experimentally and might be relevant in contexts beyond neuroscience.

1225,Consistent Inter-Model Specification for Time-Homogeneous SPX Stochastic Volatility and VIX Market Models,"  This paper shows how to recover stochastic volatility models (SVMs) from
market models for the VIX futures term structure. Market models have more
flexibility for fitting of curves than do SVMs, and therefore they are
better-suited for pricing VIX futures and derivatives. But the VIX itself is a
derivative of the S&P500 (SPX) and it is common practice to price SPX
derivatives using an SVM. Hence, a consistent model for both SPX and VIX
derivatives would be one where the SVM is obtained by inverting the market
model. This paper's main result is a method for the recovery of a stochastic
volatility function as the output of an inverse problem, with the inputs given
by a VIX futures market model. Analysis will show that some conditions need to
be met in order for there to not be any inter-model arbitrage or mis-priced
derivatives. Given these conditions the inverse problem can be solved. Several
models are analyzed and explored numerically to gain a better understanding of
the theory and its limitations.

1226,Characterization of catastrophic instabilities: Market crashes as paradigm,"  Catastrophic events, though rare, do occur and when they occur, they have
devastating effects. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to understand the
complexity of the underlying dynamics and signatures of catastrophic events,
such as market crashes. For deeper understanding, we choose the US and Japanese
markets from 1985 onward, and study the evolution of the cross-correlation
structures of stock return matrices and their eigenspectra over different short
time-intervals or ""epochs"". A slight non-linear distortion is applied to the
correlation matrix computed for any epoch, leading to the emerging spectrum of
eigenvalues. The statistical properties of the emerging spectrum display: (i)
the shape of the emerging spectrum reflects the market instability, (ii) the
smallest eigenvalue may be able to statistically distinguish the nature of a
market turbulence or crisis -- internal instability or external shock, and
(iii) the time-lagged smallest eigenvalue has a statistically significant
correlation with the mean market cross-correlation. The smallest eigenvalue
seems to indicate that the financial market has become more turbulent in a
similar way as the mean does. Yet we show features of the smallest eigenvalue
of the emerging spectrum that distinguish different types of market
instabilities related to internal or external causes. Based on the paradigmatic
character of financial time series for other complex systems, the capacity of
the emerging spectrum to understand the nature of instability may be a new
feature, which can be broadly applied.

1227,A closed formula for illiquid corporate bonds and an application to the European market,"  We deduce a simple closed formula for illiquid corporate coupon bond prices
when liquid bonds with similar characteristics (e.g. maturity) are present in
the market for the same issuer. The key model parameter is the
time-to-liquidate a position, i.e. the time that an experienced bond trader
takes to liquidate a given position on a corporate coupon bond.
The option approach we propose for pricing bonds' illiquidity is reminiscent
of the celebrated work of Longstaff (1995) on the non-marketability of some
non-dividend-paying shares in IPOs. This approach describes a quite common
situation in the fixed income market: it is rather usual to find issuers that,
besides liquid benchmark bonds, issue some other bonds that either are placed
to a small number of investors in private placements or have a limited issue
size.
The model considers interest rate and credit spread term structures and their
dynamics. We show that illiquid bonds present an additional liquidity spread
that depends on the time-to-liquidate aside from credit and interest rate
parameters. We provide a detailed application for two issuers in the European
market.

1228,The Stretch to Stray on Time: Resonant Length of Random Walks in a Transient,"  First-passage times in random walks have a vast number of diverse
applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. In general,
environmental conditions for a stochastic process are not constant on the time
scale of the average first-passage time, or control might be applied to reduce
noise. We investigate moments of the first-passage time distribution under a
transient describing relaxation of environmental conditions. We solve the
Laplace-transformed (generalized) master equation analytically using a novel
method that is applicable to general state schemes. The first-passage time from
one end to the other of a linear chain of states is our application for the
solutions. The dependence of its average on the relaxation rate obeys a power
law for slow transients. The exponent $\nu$ depends on the chain length $N$
like $\nu=-N/(N+1)$ to leading order. Slow transients substantially reduce the
noise of first-passage times expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV),
even if the average first-passage time is much longer than the transient. The
CV has a pronounced minimum for some lengths, which we call resonant lengths.
These results also suggest a simple and efficient noise control strategy, and
are closely related to the timing of repetitive excitations, coherence
resonance and information transmission by noisy excitable systems. A resonant
number of steps from the inhibited state to the excitation threshold and slow
recovery from negative feedback provide optimal timing noise reduction and
information transmission.

tool for statistically consistent inference of a gene tree under simple

distance, coupled with a distance-based tree construction method, also permits
consistent inference of species trees under mixture models appropriate to
aligned genomic-scale sequences data. Data may include sites from many genetic
loci, which evolved on different gene trees due to incomplete lineage sorting
on an ultrametric species tree, with different time-reversible substitution
processes. The simplicity and speed of distance-based inference suggests
log-det based methods should serve as benchmarks for judging more elaborate and
computationally-intensive species trees inference methods.

1230,Explaining Parochialism: A Causal Account for Political Polarization in Changing Economic Environments,"  Political and social polarization are a significant cause of conflict and
poor governance in many societies, thus understanding their causes is of
considerable importance. Here we demonstrate that shifts in socialization
strategy similar to political polarization and/or identity politics could be a
constructive response to periods of apparent economic decline. We start from
the observation that economies, like ecologies are seldom at equilibrium.
Rather, they often suffer both negative and positive shocks. We show that even
where in an expanding economy, interacting with diverse out-groups can afford
benefits through innovation and exploration, if that economy contracts, a
strategy of seeking homogeneous groups can be important to maintaining
individual solvency. This is true even where the expected value of out group
interaction exceeds that of in group interactions. Our account unifies what
were previously seen as conflicting explanations: identity threat versus
economic anxiety. Our model indicates that in periods of extreme deprivation,
cooperation with diversity again becomes the best (in fact, only viable)
strategy. However, our model also shows that while polarization may increase
gradually in response to shifts in the economy, gradual decrease of
polarization may not be an available strategy; thus returning to previous
levels of cooperation may require structural change.

development of eye diseases such as keratoconus, a common disease in which the
cornea thins and bulges into a conical shape. However, measuring biomechanical
changes in vivo with sufficient sensitivity for disease detection has proved
challenging. Here, we present a first large-scale study (~200 subjects,
including normal and keratoconus patients) using Brillouin light-scattering
microscopy to measure longitudinal modulus in corneal tissues with high
sensitivity and spatial resolution. Our results in vivo provide evidence of
biomechanical inhomogeneity at the onset of keratoconus and suggest that
biomechanical asymmetry between the left and right eyes may presage disease
development. We additionally measure the stiffening effect of corneal
crosslinking treatment in vivo for the first time. Our results demonstrate the
promise of Brillouin microscopy for diagnosis and treatment of keratoconus, and
potentially other diseases.

1233,Instantaneous Arbitrage and the CAPM,"  This paper studies the concept of instantaneous arbitrage in continuous time
and its relation to the instantaneous CAPM. Absence of instantaneous arbitrage
is equivalent to the existence of a trading strategy which satisfies the CAPM
beta pricing relation in place of the market. Thus the difference between the
arbitrage argument and the CAPM argument in Black and Scholes (1973) is this:
the arbitrage argument assumes that there exists some portfolio satisfying the
capm equation, whereas the CAPM argument assumes, in addition, that this
portfolio is the market portfolio.

1234,How strong are correlations in strongly recurrent neuronal networks?,"  Cross-correlations in the activity in neural networks are commonly used to
characterize their dynamical states and their anatomical and functional
organizations. Yet, how these latter network features affect the spatiotemporal
structure of the correlations in recurrent networks is not fully understood.
Here, we develop a general theory for the emergence of correlated neuronal
activity from the dynamics in strongly recurrent networks consisting of several
populations of binary neurons. We apply this theory to the case in which the
connectivity depends on the anatomical or functional distance between the
neurons. We establish the architectural conditions under which the system
settles into a dynamical state where correlations are strong, highly robust and
spatially modulated. We show that such strong correlations arise if the network
exhibits an effective feedforward structure. We establish how this feedforward
structure determines the way correlations scale with the network size and the
degree of the connectivity. In networks lacking an effective feedforward
structure correlations are extremely small and only weakly depend on the number
of connections per neuron. Our work shows how strong correlations can be
consistent with highly irregular activity in recurrent networks, two key
features of neuronal dynamics in the central nervous system.

1235,A six-factor asset pricing model,"  The present study introduce the human capital component to the Fama and
French five-factor model proposing an equilibrium six-factor asset pricing
model. The study employs an aggregate of four sets of portfolios mimicking size
and industry with varying dimensions. The first set consists of three set of
six portfolios each sorted on size to B/M, size to investment, and size to
momentum. The second set comprises of five index portfolios, third, a four-set
of twenty-five portfolios each sorted on size to B/M, size to investment, size
to profitability, and size to momentum, and the final set constitute thirty
industry portfolios. To estimate the parameters of six-factor asset pricing
model for the four sets of variant portfolios, we use OLS and Generalized
method of moments based robust instrumental variables technique (IVGMM). The
results obtained from the relevance, endogeneity, overidentifying restrictions,
and the Hausman's specification, tests indicate that the parameter estimates of
the six-factor model using IVGMM are robust and performs better than the OLS
approach. The human capital component shares equally the predictive power
alongside the factors in the framework in explaining the variations in return
on portfolios. Furthermore, we assess the t-ratio of the human capital
component of each IVGMM estimates of the six-factor asset pricing model for the
four sets of variant portfolios. The t-ratio of the human capital of the
eighty-three IVGMM estimates are more than 3.00 with reference to the standard
proposed by Harvey et al. (2016). This indicates the empirical success of the
six-factor asset-pricing model in explaining the variation in asset returns.

1236,Particle-without-Particle: a practical pseudospectral collocation method for linear partial differential equations with distributional sources,"  Partial differential equations with distributional sources---in particular,
involving (derivatives of) delta distributions---have become increasingly
ubiquitous in numerous areas of physics and applied mathematics. It is often of
considerable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but any
singular (""particle""-like) source modeling invariably introduces nontrivial
computational obstacles. A common method to circumvent these is through some
form of delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid;
however, this often carries significant limitations on the efficiency of the
numerical convergence rates, or sometimes even the resolvability of the problem
at all.
In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such
equations which avoids the singular behavior entirely: the
""Particle-without-Particle"" method. Previously introduced in the context of the
self-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to discretize the
computational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral
(Chebyshev-Lobatto) grids such that the ""particle"" is always at the interface
between them; thus, one only needs to solve homogeneous equations in each
domain, with the source effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions
thereon. We prove here that this method yields solutions to any linear PDE the
source of which is any linear combination of delta distributions and
derivatives thereof supported on a one-dimensional subspace of the problem
domain. We then implement it to numerically solve a variety of relevant PDEs:
hyperbolic (with applications to neuroscience and acoustics), parabolic (with
applications to finance), and elliptic. We generically obtain improved
convergence rates relative to typical past implementations relying on delta
function approximations.

revealed large hydrodynamic vortices generated by colony and flock rotations,
providing a likely source of the forces leading to flocking and optimal

1238,Conformation Clustering of Long MD Protein Dynamics with an Adversarial Autoencoder,"  Recent developments in specialized computer hardware have greatly accelerated
atomic level Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. A single GPU-attached cluster
is capable of producing microsecond-length trajectories in reasonable amounts
of time. Multiple protein states and a large number of microstates associated
with folding and with the function of the protein can be observed as
conformations sampled in the trajectories. Clustering those conformations,
however, is needed for identifying protein states, evaluating transition rates
and understanding protein behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel
data-driven generative conformation clustering method based on the adversarial
autoencoder (AAE) and provide the associated software implementation Cong. The
method was tested using a 208 microseconds MD simulation of the fast-folding
peptide Trp-Cage (20 residues) obtained from the D.E. Shaw Research Group. The
proposed clustering algorithm identifies many of the salient features of the
folding process by grouping a large number of conformations that share common
features not easily identifiable in the trajectory.

1239,Implementing a Concept Network Model,"  The same concept can mean different things or be instantiated in different
forms depending on context, suggesting a degree of flexibility within the
conceptual system. We propose that a compositional network model can be used to
capture and predict this flexibility. We modeled individual concepts (e.g.,
BANANA, BOTTLE) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g.,
YELLOW, SWEET) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In
this framework, networks capture the within-concept statistics that reflect how
properties correlate with each other across instances of a concept. We ran a
classification analysis using graph eigendecomposition to validate these
models, and find that these models can successfully discriminate between object
concepts. We then computed formal measures from these concept networks and
explored their relationship to conceptual structure. We find that diversity
coefficients and core-periphery structure can be interpreted as network-based
measures of conceptual flexibility and stability, respectively. These results
support the feasibility of a concept network framework and highlight its
ability to formally capture important characteristics of the conceptual system.

precipitated by a common exogenous stress to the trading book of all firms in
the financial system. In this setting, firms are constrained so as to satisfy a
risk-weight based capital ratio requirement. We use this model to find
analytical bounds on the risk-weights for an asset as a function of the market
liquidity. Under these appropriate risk-weights, we find existence and
uniqueness for the joint system of firm behavior and the asset price. We
further consider an analytical bound on the firm liquidations, which allows us
to construct exact formulas for stress testing the financial system with
deterministic or random stresses. Numerical case studies are provided to
demonstrate various implications of this model and analytical bounds.

Projective Consciousness Model. The model accounts for all documented
modulations of the illusion without anomalies (e.g., the size-distance
paradox), surpasses other theories in explanatory power, makes sense of inter-

1242,New indicators for assessing the quality of in silico produced biomolecules: the case study of the aptamer-Angiopoietin-2 complex,"  Computational procedures to foresee the 3D structure of aptamers are in
continuous progress. They constitute a crucial input to research, mainly when
the crystallographic counterpart of the structures in silico produced is not
present. At now, many codes are able to perform structure and binding
prediction, although their ability in scoring the results remains rather weak.
In this paper, we propose a novel procedure to complement the ranking outcomes
of free docking code, by applying it to a set of anti-angiopoietin aptamers,
whose performances are known. We rank the in silico produced configurations,
adopting a maximum likelihood estimate, based on their topological and
electrical properties. From the analysis, two principal kinds of conformers are
identified, whose ability to mimick the binding features of the natural
receptor is discussed. The procedure is easily generalizable to many biological
biomolecules, useful for increasing chances of success in designing
high-specificity biosensors (aptasensors).

the detection of genomic breakpoints as a prerequisite of calling copy number
alterations (CNA). This, however, is still challenging and requires
time-consuming manual curation. As deep-learning methods outperformed classical
state-of-the-art algorithms in various domains and have also been successfully
applied to life science problems including medicine and biology, we here
propose Deep SNP, a novel Deep Neural Network to learn from genomic data.
Specifically, we used a manually curated dataset from 12 genomic single
nucleotide polymorphism array (SNPa) profiles as truth-set and aimed at
predicting the presence or absence of genomic breakpoints, an indicator of
structural chromosomal variations, in windows of 40,000 probes. We compare our
results with well-known neural network models as well as Rawcopy though this
tool is designed to predict breakpoints and in addition genomic segments with
high sensitivity. We show, that Deep SNP is capable of successfully predicting
the presence or absence of a breakpoint in large genomic windows and
outperforms state-of-the-art neural network models. Qualitative examples
suggest that integration of a localization unit may enable breakpoint detection
and prediction of genomic segments, even if the breakpoint coordinates were not
provided for network training. These results warrant further evaluation of
DeepSNP for breakpoint localization and subsequent calling of genomic segments.

1245,Gradient Sensing via Cell Communication,"  The chemotactic dynamics of cells and organisms that have no specialized
gradient sensing organelles is not well understood. In fact, chemotaxis of this
sort of organism is especially challenging to explain when the external
chemical gradient is so small as to make variations of concentrations minute
over the length of each of the organisms. Experimental evidence lends support
to the conjecture that chemotactic behavior of chains of cells can be achieved
via cell-to-cell communication. This is the chemotactic basis for the Local
Excitation, Global Inhibition (LEGI) model.
A generalization of the model for the communication component of the LEGI
model is proposed. Doing so permits us to study in detail how gradient sensing
changes as a function of the structure of the communication term. The key
findings of this study are, an accounting of how gradient sensing is affected
by the competition of communication and diffusive processes; the determination
of the scale dependence of the model outcomes; the sensitivity of communication
to parameters in the model. Together with an essential analysis of the dynamics
of the model, these findings can prove useful in suggesting experiments aimed
at determining the viability of a communication mechanism in chemotactic
dynamics of chains and networks of cells exposed to a chemical concentration
gradient.

cognitive functions. Prior studies have explored the cortical oscillation and
power spectral differing from the resting-state conduction to oddball paradigm,
but whether brain networks existing the significant difference is still
unclear. Our study addressed how the brain reconfigures its architecture from a
resting-state condition (i.e., baseline) to P300 stimulus task in the visual
oddball paradigm. In this study, electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets were
collected from 24 postgraduate students, who were required to only mentally
count the number of target stimulus; afterwards the functional EEG networks
constructed in different frequency bands were compared between baseline and
oddball task conditions to evaluate the reconfiguration of functional network
in the brain. Compared to the baseline, our results showed the significantly (p
< 0.05) enhanced delta/theta EEG connectivity and decreased alpha default mode
network in the progress of brain reconfiguration to the P300 task. Furthermore,
the reconfigured coupling strengths were demonstrated to relate to P300
amplitudes, which were then regarded as input features to train a classifier to
differentiate the high and low P300 amplitudes groups with an accuracy of
77.78%. The findings of our study help us to understand the changes of
functional brain connectivity from resting-state to oddball stimulus task, and
the reconfigured network pattern has the potential for the selection of good
subjects for P300-based brain- computer interface.

1247,Interpretable LSTMs For Whole-Brain Neuroimaging Analyses,"  The analysis of neuroimaging data poses several strong challenges, in
particular, due to its high dimensionality, its strong spatio-temporal
correlation and the comparably small sample sizes of the respective datasets.
To address these challenges, conventional decoding approaches such as the
searchlight reduce the complexity of the decoding problem by considering local
clusters of voxels only. Thereby, neglecting the distributed spatial patterns
of brain activity underlying many cognitive states. In this work, we introduce
the DLight framework, which overcomes these challenges by utilizing a long
short-term memory unit (LSTM) based deep neural network architecture to analyze
the spatial dependency structure of whole-brain fMRI data. In order to maintain
interpretability of the neuroimaging data, we adapt the layer-wise relevance
propagation (LRP) method. Thereby, we enable the neuroscientist user to study
the learned association of the LSTM between the data and the cognitive state of
the individual. We demonstrate the versatility of DLight by applying it to a
large fMRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project. We show that the decoding
performance of our method scales better with large datasets, and moreover
outperforms conventional decoding approaches, while still detecting
physiologically appropriate brain areas for the cognitive states classified. We
also demonstrate that DLight is able to detect these areas on several levels of
data granularity (i.e., group, subject, trial, time point).

1248,On the variance of internode distance under the multispecies coalescent,"  We consider the problem of estimating species trees from unrooted gene tree
topologies in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, a common phenomenon
that creates gene tree heterogeneity in multilocus datasets. One popular class
of reconstruction methods in this setting is based on internode distances, i.e.
the average graph distance between pairs of species across gene trees. While
statistical consistency in the limit of large numbers of loci has been
established in some cases, little is known about the sample complexity of such
methods. Here we make progress on this question by deriving a lower bound on
the worst-case variance of internode distance which depends linearly on the
corresponding graph distance in the species tree. We also discuss some
algorithmic implications.

1249,A multiple timescales approach to bridging spiking- and population-level dynamics,"  A rigorous bridge between spiking-level and macroscopic quantities is an
on-going and well-developed story for asynchronously firing neurons, but focus
has shifted to include neural populations exhibiting varying synchronous
dynamics. Recent literature has used the Ott--Antonsen ansatz (2008) to great
effect, allowing a rigorous derivation of an order parameter for large
oscillator populations. The ansatz has been successfully applied using several
models including networks of Kuramoto oscillators, theta models, and
integrate-and-fire neurons, along with many types of network topologies. In the
present study, we take a converse approach: given the mean field dynamics of
slow synapses, predict the synchronization properties of finite neural
populations. The slow synapse assumption is amenable to averaging theory and
the method of multiple timescales. Our proposed theory applies to two
heterogeneous populations of N excitatory n-dimensional and N inhibitory
m-dimensional oscillators with homogeneous synaptic weights. We then
demonstrate our theory using two examples. In the first example we take a
network of excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons and consider the case with
and without heterogeneous inputs. In the second example we use Traub models
with calcium for the excitatory neurons and Wang-Buzs{ÃƒÂ¡}ki models for the
inhibitory neurons. We accurately predict phase drift and phase locking in each
example even when the slow synapses exhibit non-trivial mean-field dynamics.

1250,Improving Stock Movement Prediction with Adversarial Training,"  This paper contributes a new machine learning solution for stock movement
prediction, which aims to predict whether the price of a stock will be up or
down in the near future. The key novelty is that we propose to employ
adversarial training to improve the generalization of a recurrent neural
network model. The rationality of adversarial training here is that the input
features to stock prediction are typically based on stock price, which is
essentially a stochastic variable and continuously changed with time by nature.
As such, normal training with stationary price-based features (e.g. the closing
price) can easily overfit the data, being insufficient to obtain reliable
models. To address this problem, we propose to add perturbations to simulate
the stochasticity of continuous price variable, and train the model to work
well under small yet intentional perturbations. Extensive experiments on two
real-world stock data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
solution with 3.11% relative improvements on average w.r.t. accuracy, verifying
the usefulness of adversarial training for stock prediction task. Codes will be
made available upon acceptance.

1251,Generalizing the first-difference correlated random walk for marine animal movement data,"  Animal telemetry data are often analysed with discrete time movement models
assuming rotation in the movement. These models are defined with equidistant
distant time steps. However, telemetry data from marine animals are observed
irregularly. To account for irregular data, a time-irregularised
first-difference correlated random walk model with drift is introduced. The
model generalizes the commonly used first-difference correlated random walk
with regular time steps by allowing irregular time steps, including a drift
term, and by allowing different autocorrelation in the two coordinates. The
model is applied to data from a ringed seal collected through the Argos
satellite system, and is compared to related movement models through
simulations. Accounting for irregular data in the movement model results in
accurate parameter estimates and reconstruction of movement paths. Measured by
distance, the introduced model can provide more accurate movement paths than
the regular time counterpart. Extracting accurate movement paths from uncertain
telemetry data is important for evaluating space use patterns for marine
animals, which in turn is crucial for management. Further, handling irregular
data directly in the movement model allows efficient simultaneous analysis of
several animals.

skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Given its
high prevalence in net pen salmon, debate has arisen on whether PRV poses a
risk to migratory salmon, especially in British Columbia (BC) where
commercially important wild Pacific salmon are in decline. Various strains of
PRV have been associated with diseases in Pacific salmon, including
erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS), HSMI-like disease, and
jaundice/anemia in Japan, Norway, Chile and Canada. We examine the
developmental pathway of HSMI and jaundice/anemia associated with PRV-1 in
farmed Atlantic and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon in BC,
respectively. In situ hybridization localized PRV-1 within developing lesions
in both diseases. The two diseases showed dissimilar pathological pathways,
with inflammatory lesions in heart and skeletal muscle in Atlantic salmon, and
degenerative-necrotic lesions in kidney and liver in Chinook salmon, plausibly
explained by differences in PRV load tolerance in red blood cells. Viral genome
sequencing revealed no consistent differences in PRV-1 variants intimately
involved in the development of both diseases, suggesting that migratory Chinook
salmon may be at more than a minimal risk of disease from exposure to the high
levels of PRV occurring on salmon farms.

1254,On the Analysis of Bacterial Cooperation with a Characterization of 2D Signal Propagation,"  The exchange of small molecular signals within microbial populations is
generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS). QS is ubiquitous in nature and
enables microorganisms to respond to fluctuations of living environments by
working together. In this work, a QS-based communication system within a
microbial population in a two-dimensional (2D) environment is analytically
modeled. Notably, the diffusion and degradation of signaling molecules within
the population is characterized. Microorganisms are randomly distributed on a
2D circle where each one releases molecules at random times. The number of
molecules observed at each randomly-distributed bacterium is analyzed. Using
this analysis and some approximation, the expected density of cooperating
bacteria is derived. The analytical results are validated via a particle-based
simulation method. The model can be used to predict and control behavioral
dynamics of microscopic populations that have imperfect signal propagation.

1255,A Biomechanical Study on the Use of Curved Drilling Technique for Treatment of Osteonecrosis of Femoral Head,"  Osteonecrosis occurs due to the loss of blood supply to the bone, leading to
spontaneous death of the trabecular bone. Delayed treatment of the involved
patients results in collapse of the femoral head, which leads to a need for
total hip arthroplasty surgery. Core decompression, as the most popular
technique for treatment of the osteonecrosis, includes removal of the lesion
area by drilling a straight tunnel to the lesion, debriding the dead bone and
replacing it with bone substitutes. However, there are two drawbacks for this
treatment method. First, due to the rigidity of the instruments currently used
during core decompression, lesions cannot be completely removed and/or
excessive healthy bone may also be removed with the lesion. Second, the use of
bone substitutes, despite its biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, may not
provide sufficient mechanical strength and support for the bone. To address
these shortcomings, a novel robot-assisted curved core decompression (CCD)
technique is introduced to provide surgeons with direct access to the lesions
causing minimal damage to the healthy bone. In this study, with the aid of
finite element (FE) simulations, we investigate biomechanical performance of
core decompression using the curved drilling technique in the presence of
normal gait loading. In this regard, we compare the result of the CCD using
bone substitutes and flexible implants with other conventional core
decompression techniques. The study finding shows that the maximum principal
stress occurring at the superior domain of the neck is smaller in the CCD
techniques (i.e. 52.847 MPa) compared to the other core decompression methods.

neuroscientists to collect multilevel and multichannel brain data to better

secure and reliable data communication between end-to-end (E2E) devices
supported by current IoT and cloud infrastructure, trust management is needed
at the IoT and user ends. This paper introduces a Neuro-Fuzzy based
Brain-inspired trust management model (TMM) to secure IoT devices and relay
nodes, and to ensure data reliability. The proposed TMM utilizes node
behavioral trust and data trust estimated using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
System and weighted-additive methods respectively to assess the nodes
trustworthiness. In contrast to the existing fuzzy based TMMs, the NS2
simulation results confirm the robustness and accuracy of the proposed TMM in
identifying malicious nodes in the communication network. With the growing

$\textbf{Methods}$: Automatic scorings were confronted with results from
human expert scorers on a total of 2768 full-night PSG recordings obtained from
two different databases. Of them, 472 recordings were obtained during clinical
routine at our sleep center and were subdivided into two subgroups of 220

the clinical expert during the visual review (semi-automatic or purely manual,
respectively). In addition, 2296 recordings from the public SHHS-2 database
were evaluated against the respective manual expert scorings.
$\textbf{Results}$: Event-by-event epoch-based validation resulted in an
overall Cohen kappa agreement K = 0.600 (HMC-S), 0.559 (HMC-M), and 0.573
(SHHS-2). Estimated inter-scorer variability on the datasets was, respectively,

1261,The sequential loss of allelic diversity,"  This paper gives a new flavor of what Peter Jagers and his co-authors call
`the path to extinction'. In a neutral population with constant size $N$, we
assume that each individual at time $0$ carries a distinct type, or allele. We
consider the joint dynamics of these $N$ alleles, for example the dynamics of
their respective frequencies and more plainly the nonincreasing process
counting the number of alleles remaining by time $t$. We call this process the
extinction process. We show that in the Moran model, the extinction process is
distributed as the process counting (in backward time) the number of common
ancestors to the whole population, also known as the block counting process of
the $N$-Kingman coalescent. Stimulated by this result, we investigate: (1)
whether it extends to an identity between the frequencies of blocks in the
Kingman coalescent and the frequencies of alleles in the extinction process,
both evaluated at jump times; (2) whether it extends to the general case of
$\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes.

users to directly answer yes or no questions by covertly rehearsing the word
'yes' or 'no' for 15 s. The BCI also admits an equivalent duration of
unconstrained rest which constitutes the third discernable task. Twelve
participants each completed one offline block and six online blocks over the
course of 2 sessions. The mean value of the change in oxygenated hemoglobin
concentration during a trial was calculated for each channel and used to train
a regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) classifier. By the final
online block, 9 out of 12 participants were performing above chance (p<0.001),
with a 3-class accuracy of 83.8+9.4%. Even when considering all participants,
the average online 3-class accuracy over the last 3 blocks was 64.1+20.6%, with
only 3 participants scoring below chance (p<0.001). For most participants,
channels in the left temporal and temporoparietal cortex provided the most
discriminative information. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an
online fNIRS 3-class imagined speech BCI. Our findings suggest that imagined
speech can be used as a reliable activation task for selected users for the
development of more intuitive BCIs for communication.

1263,A Parsimonious Dynamical Model for Structural Learning in the Human Brain,"  The human brain is capable of diverse feats of intelligence. A particularly
salient example is the ability to deduce structure from time-varying auditory
and visual stimuli, enabling humans to master the rules of language and to
build rich expectations of their physical environment. The broad relevance of
this ability for human cognition motivates the need for a first-principles
model explicating putative mechanisms. Here we propose a general framework for
structural learning in the brain, composed of an evolving, high-dimensional
dynamical system driven by external stimuli or internal processes. We
operationalize the scenario in which humans learn the rules that generate a
sequence of stimuli, rather than the exemplar stimuli themselves. We model
external stimuli as seemingly disordered chaotic time series generated by
complex dynamical systems; the underlying structure being deduced is then that
of the corresponding chaotic attractor. This approach allows us to demonstrate
and theoretically explain the emergence of five distinct phenomena reminiscent
of cognitive functions: (i) learning the structure of a chaotic system purely
from time series, (ii) generating new streams of stimuli from a chaotic system,
(iii) switching stream generation among multiple learned chaotic systems,
either spontaneously or in response to external perturbations, (iv) inferring
missing data from sparse observations of the chaotic system, and (v)
deciphering superimposed input from different chaotic systems. Numerically, we
show that these phenomena emerge naturally from a recurrent neural network of
Erdos-Renyi topology in which the synaptic strengths adapt in a Hebbian-like
manner. Broadly, our work blends chaotic theory and artificial neural networks
to answer the long standing question of how neural systems can learn the
structure underlying temporal sequences of stimuli.

1264,"Connecting the dots between mechanosensitive channel abundance, osmotic shock, and survival at single-cell resolution","  Rapid changes in extracellular osmolarity are one of many insults microbial
cells face on a daily basis. To protect against such shocks, Escherichia coli
and other microbes express several types of transmembrane channels which open
and close in response to changes in membrane tension. In E. coli, one of the
most abundant channels is the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance
(MscL). While this channel has been heavily characterized through structural
methods, electrophysiology, and theoretical modeling, our understanding of its
physiological role in preventing cell death by alleviating high membrane
tension remains tenuous. In this work, we examine the contribution of MscL
alone to cell survival after osmotic shock at single cell resolution using
quantitative fluorescence microscopy. We conduct these experiments in an E.
coli strain which is lacking all mechanosensitive channel genes save for MscL
whose expression is tuned across three orders of magnitude through
modifications of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. While theoretical models suggest
that only a few MscL channels would be needed to alleviate even large changes
in osmotic pressure, we find that between 500 and 700 channels per cell are
needed to convey upwards of 80% survival. This number agrees with the average
MscL copy number measured in wild-type E. coli cells through proteomic studies
and quantitative Western blotting. Furthermore, we observe zero survival events
in cells with less than 100 channels per cell. This work opens new questions
concerning the contribution of other mechanosensitive channels to survival as
well as regulation of their activity.

1265,Entropy Production Rate is Maximized in Non-Contractile Actomyosin,"  The actin cytoskeleton is an active semi-flexible polymer network whose
non-equilibrium properties coordinate both stable and contractile behaviors to
maintain or change cell shape. While myosin motors drive the actin cytoskeleton
out-of-equilibrium, the role of myosin-driven active stresses in the
accumulation and dissipation of mechanical energy is unclear. To investigate
this, we synthesize an actomyosin material in vitro whose active stress content
can tune the network from stable to contractile. Each increment in activity
determines a characteristic spectrum of actin filament fluctuations which is
used to calculate the total mechanical work and the production of entropy in
the material. We find that the balance of work and entropy does not increase
monotonically and, surprisingly, the entropy production rate is maximized in
the non-contractile, stable state. Our study provides evidence that the origins
of system entropy production and activity-dependent dissipation arise from
disorder in the molecular interactions between actin and myosin

1266,When do we have the power to detect biological interactions in spatial point patterns?,"  Determining the relative importance of environmental factors, biotic
interactions and stochasticity in assembling and maintaining species-rich
communities remains a major challenge in ecology. In plant communities,
interactions between individuals of different species are expected to leave a
spatial signature in the form of positive or negative spatial correlations over
distances relating to the spatial scale of interaction. Most studies using
spatial point process tools have found relatively little evidence for
interactions between pairs of species. More interactions tend to be detected in
communities with fewer species. However, there is currently no understanding of
how the power to detect spatial interactions may change with sample size, or
the scale and intensity of interactions.
We use a simple 2-species model where the scale and intensity of interactions
are controlled to simulate point pattern data. In combination with an
approximation to the variance of the spatial summary statistics that we sample,
we investigate the power of current spatial point pattern methods to correctly
reject the null model of bivariate species independence.
We show that the power to detect interactions is positively related to the
abundances of the species tested, and the intensity and scale of interactions.
Increasing imbalance in abundances has a negative effect on the power to detect
interactions. At population sizes typically found in currently available
datasets for species-rich plant communities we find only a very low power to
detect interactions. Differences in power may explain the increased frequency
of interactions in communities with fewer species. Furthermore, the
community-wide frequency of detected interactions is very sensitive to a
minimum abundance criterion for including species in the analyses.

develop a stylized model to study the effects of ranking algorithms on opinion
dynamics. We consider a search engine that uses an algorithm based on
popularity and on personalization. We find that popularity-based rankings
generate an advantage of the fewer effect: fewer websites reporting a given
signal attract relatively more traffic overall. This highlights a novel,
ranking-driven channel that explains the diffusion of misinformation, as
websites reporting incorrect information may attract an amplified amount of
traffic precisely because they are few. Furthermore, when individuals provide
sufficiently positive feedback to the ranking algorithm, popularity-based
rankings tend to aggregate information while personalization acts in the
opposite direction.

(scRNA-seq) have enabled transcriptome profiling of rare cells without having
to pool multiple samples or to perform RNA extraction. We term this approach
limiting-cell RNA-seq (lcRNA-seq). Unlike scRNA-seq, which focuses on
'cell-atlasing', lcRNA-seq focuses on identifying differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) between experimental groups. This requires accounting for systems
noise which can obscure biological differences. We present CLEAR, a workflow
that identifies robust transcripts in lcRNA-seq data for between-group
comparisons. To develop CLEAR, we compared DEGs from RNA extracted from
FACS-derived CD5+ and CD5- cells from a single chronic lymphocytic leukemia
patient diluted to input RNA levels of 10-, 100- and 1,000pg. Data quality at
ultralow input levels are known to be noisy. When using CLEAR transcripts vs.
using all available transcripts, downstream analyses reveal more shared DEGs,
improved Principal Component Analysis separation of cell type, and increased
similarity between results across different input RNA amounts. CLEAR was
applied to two publicly available ultralow input RNA-seq data and an in-house
murine neural cell lcRNA-seq dataset. CLEAR provides a novel way to visualize
the public datasets while validates cell phenotype markers for astrocytes,
neural stem and progenitor cells.

strategy of an insurance company which wishes to maximize the expected
exponential utility of its terminal wealth in a finite time horizon. Our goal
is to extend the classical Cramer-Lundberg model introducing a stochastic
factor which affects the intensity of the claims arrival process, described by
a Cox process, as well as the insurance and reinsurance premia. Using the
classical stochastic control approach based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation we characterize the optimal strategy and provide a verification result
for the value function via classical solutions of two backward partial
differential equations. Existence and uniqueness of these solutions are
discussed. Results under various premium calculation principles are illustrated
and a new premium calculation rule is proposed in order to get more realistic
strategies and to better fit our stochastic factor model. Finally, numerical
simulations are performed to obtain sensitivity analyses.

1270,Effects of atrial fibrillation on the arterial fluid dynamics: a modelling perspective,"  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia with
accelerated and irregular heart rate (HR), leading to both heart failure and
stroke and being responsible for an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. In spite of its importance, the direct effects of AF on the arterial
hemodynamic patterns are not completely known to date. Based on a multiscale
modelling approach, the proposed work investigates the effects of AF on the
local arterial fluid dynamics. AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) conditions are
simulated extracting 2000 $\mathrm{RR}$ heartbeats and comparing the most
relevant cardiac and vascular parameters at the same HR (75 bpm). Present
outcomes evidence that the arterial system is not able to completely absorb the
AF-induced variability, which can be even amplified towards the peripheral
circulation. AF is also able to locally alter the wave dynamics, by modifying
the interplay between forward and backward signals. The sole heart rhythm
variation (i.e., from NSR to AF) promotes an alteration of the regular dynamics
at the arterial level which, in terms of pressure and peripheral perfusion,
suggests a modification of the physiological phenomena ruled by periodicity
(e.g., regular organ perfusion)and a possible vascular dysfunction due to the
prolonged exposure to irregular and extreme values. The present study
represents a first modeling approach to characterize the variability of
arterial hemodynamics in presence of AF, which surely deserves further clinical
investigation.

1271,Eco-evolutionary feedbacks - theoretical models and perspectives,"  1. Theoretical models pertaining to feedbacks between ecological and
evolutionary processes are prevalent in multiple biological fields. An
integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the
fields and the use of different methodological approaches.
2. Here we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and
highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur
both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including
populations, communities, and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks
across spatial scales.
3. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying
assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of
eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled
by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of
these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues.
4. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been
incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not
always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and
evolutionary time scales. We discuss the importance of density- and
frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of
dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial
context.

experiments where persistent activity patterns encode internal representations
of external attributes like head direction or spatial location. However, the
conditions under which the emergent bump of neural activity in such networks
can be manipulated by space and time-dependent external sensory or motor
signals are not understood. Here, we find fundamental limits on how rapidly
internal representations encoded along continuous attractors can be updated by
an external signal. We apply these results to place cell networks to derive a
velocity-dependent non-equilibrium memory capacity in neural networks.

1273,Simple property of heterogeneous aspiration dynamics: Beyond weak selection,"  How individuals adapt their behavior in cultural evolution remains elusive.
Theoretical studies have shown that the update rules chosen to model individual
decision making can dramatically modify the evolutionary outcome of the
population as a whole. This hints at the complexities of considering the
personality of individuals in a population, where each one uses its own rule.
Here, we investigate whether and how heterogeneity in the rules of behavior
update alters the evolutionary outcome. We assume that individuals update
behaviors by aspiration-based self-evaluation and they do so in their own ways.
Under weak selection, we analytically reveal a simple property that holds for
any two-strategy multi-player games in well-mixed populations and on regular
graphs: the evolutionary outcome in a population with heterogeneous update
rules is the weighted average of the outcomes in the corresponding homogeneous
populations, and the associated weights are the frequencies of each update rule
in the heterogeneous population. Beyond weak selection, we show that this
property holds for public goods games. Our finding implies that heterogeneous
aspiration dynamics is additive. This additivity greatly reduces the complexity
induced by the underlying individual heterogeneity. Our work thus provides an
efficient method to calculate evolutionary outcomes under heterogeneous update
rules.

liquidity variables at a five minutes time scale on equity markets around the
world: the traded volume, the bid-ask spread, the volatility and the volume at
first limits of the orderbook. In the spirit of Granger causality, we measure
the level of information by the level of accuracy of linear autoregressive
models. This empirical study is carried out on a dataset of more than 300
stocks from four different markets (US, UK, Japan and Hong Kong) from a period
of over five years. We discuss the obtained performances of autoregressive (AR)
models on stationarized versions of the variables, focusing on explaining the
observed differences between stocks.
Since empirical studies are often conducted at this time scale, we believe it
is of paramount importance to document endogenous dynamics in a simple
framework with no addition of supplemental information. Our study can hence be
used as a benchmark to identify exogenous effects. On the other hand, most
optimal trading frameworks (like the celebrated Almgren and Chriss one), focus
on computing an optimal trading speed at a frequency close to the one we
consider. Such frameworks very often take i.i.d. assumptions on liquidity
variables; this paper document the auto-correlations emerging from real data,
opening the door to new developments in optimal trading.

1275,Harnessing functional segregation across brain rhythms as a means to detect EEG oscillatory multiplexing during music listening,"  Music, being a multifaceted stimulus evolving at multiple timescales,
modulates brain function in a manifold way that encompasses not only the
distinct stages of auditory perception but also higher cognitive processes like
memory and appraisal. Network theory is apparently a promising approach to
describe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during
music listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined
within the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Using naturalistic
music, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with
different cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface EEG
measurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to
quantify the interplay among rhythms. It was also contrasted against the
structure from the rest and noise listening conditions to reveal the specific
components stemming from music listening. Our methodology includes an efficient
graph-partitioning algorithm, which is further utilized for mining prototypical
modular patterns, and a novel algorithmic procedure for identifying switching
nodes that consistently change module during music listening. Our results
suggest the multiplex character of the music-induced functional reorganization
and particularly indicate the dependence between the networks reconstructed
from the {\delta} and {\beta}H rhythms. This dependence is further justified
within the framework of nested neural oscillations and fits perfectly within
the context of recently introduced cortical entrainment to music. Considering
its computational efficiency, and in conjunction with the flexibility of in
situ electroencephalography, it may lead to novel assistive tools for real-life
applications.

nature of kinks that occur in the double helix, by measuring a reduction of the

1277,"Hybrid Sterility Can Only be Primary When Acting as a Reproductive Barrier for Sympatric Speciation,","  Parental gametes unite to form a zygote that develops into an adult with
gonads that, in turn, produce gametes. Interruption of this germinal cycle by
prezygotic or postzygotic reproductive barriers can result in two independent
cycles, each with the potential to evolve into a new species. When the
speciation process is complete, members of each species are fully
reproductively isolated from those of the other. During speciation a primary
barrier may be supported and eventually superceded by a later appearing
secondary barrier. For those holding certain cases of prezygotic isolation to
be primary (e.g. elephant cannot copulate with mouse), the onus is to show that
they had not been preceded over evolutionary time by periods of postzygotic
hybrid inviability (genically determined) or sterility (genically or
chromosomally determined). Likewise, the onus is upon those holding cases of
hybrid inviability to be primary (e.g. Dobzhansky-Muller epistatic
incompatibilities), to show that they had not been preceded by periods, however
brief, of hybrid sterility. The latter, when acting as a sympatric barrier
causing reproductive isolation, can only be primary. In many cases, hybrid
sterility may result from incompatibilities between parental chromosomes that
attempt to pair during meiosis in the gonad of their offspring
(Winge-Crowther-Bateson incompatibilities). While WCB incompatibilities have
long been observed on a microscopic scale, there is growing evidence for a role
of dispersed finer DNA sequence differences.

1278,Network flow of mobile agents enhances the evolution of cooperation,"  We study the effect of contingent movement on the persistence of cooperation
on complex networks with empty nodes. Each agent plays Prisoner's Dilemma game
with its neighbors and then it either updates the strategy depending on the
payoff difference with neighbors or it moves to another empty node if not
satisfied with its own payoff. If no neighboring node is empty, each agent
stays at the same site. By extensive evolutionary simulations, we show that the
medium density of agents enhances cooperation where the network flow of mobile
agents is also medium. Moreover, if the movements of agents are more frequent
than the strategy updating, cooperation is further promoted. In scale-free
networks, the optimal density for cooperation is lower than other networks
because agents get stuck at hubs. Our study suggests that keeping a smooth
network flow is significant for the persistence of cooperation in ever-changing
societies.

wildlife management. However, many carnivore species are cryptic, leading to
innate difficulties in estimating their populations. We evaluated the potential
for using more rigorous statistical models to estimate the populations of black
bears (Ursus americanus) in Wisconisin, and their applicability to other
furbearers such as bobcats (Lynx rufus). To estimate black bear populations, we
developed an AAH state-space model in a Bayesian framework based on Norton
(2015) that can account for variation in harvest and population demographics
over time. Our state-space model created an accurate estimate of the black bear
population in Wisconsin based on age-at-harvest data and improves on previous
models by using little demographic data, no auxiliary data, and not being
sensitive to initial population size. The increased accuracy of the AAH
state-space models should allow for better management by being able to set
accurate quotas to ensure a sustainable harvest for the black bear population
in each zone. We also evaluated the demography and annual harvest data of
bobcats in Wisconsin to determine trends in harvest, method, and hunter
participation in Wisconsin. Each trait of harvested bobcats that we tested
(mass, male:female sex ratio, and age) changed over time, and because these
were interrelated, and we inferred that harvest selection for larger size
biased harvests in favor of a) larger, b) older, and c) male bobcats by hound
hunters. We also found an increase in the proportion of bobcats that were
harvested by hound hunting compared to trapping, and that hound hunters were
more likely to create taxidermy mounts than trappers. We also found that
decreasing available bobcat tags and increasing success have occurred over
time, and correlate with substantially increasing both hunter populations and
hunter interest.

structure, facilitating the formation of topologically associating domains
(TADs). However, its direct effects on gene regulation is less well understood.
Here, we utilize previously published ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to investigate
the effects of CTCF on alternative splicing of genes with CTCF sites. We
compared the amount of RNA-seq signals in exons upstream and downstream of
binding sites following auxin-induced degradation of CTCF in mouse embryonic
stem cells. We found that changes in gene expression following CTCF depletion
were significant, with a general increase in the presence of upstream exons. We
infer that a possible mechanism by which CTCF binding contributes to
alternative splicing is by causing pauses in the transcription mechanism during
which splicing elements are able to concurrently act on upstream exons already
transcribed into RNA.

which were collected on 33 individuals in Army training program, combined with
our system approach provide unique opportunity to investigate the effect of
blast-wave exposure on gene-gene interactions. Digging into the networks, we

that are disrupted due to the exposure. Among genes with relatively high fold

S100A8, TRIM58 and ZNF654 showed major impact on the dysregulation of the

single neuron revolution emerged in neuroscience in the 1970s. They brought
many unexpected discoveries, including grandmother or concept cells and sparse
coding of information in the brain.
In machine learning for a long time, the famous curse of dimensionality
seemed to be an unsolvable problem. Nevertheless, the idea of the blessing of
dimensionality becomes gradually more and more popular. Ensembles of
non-interacting or weakly interacting simple units prove to be an effective
tool for solving essentially multidimensional problems. This approach is
especially useful for one-shot (non-iterative) correction of errors in large
legacy artificial intelligence systems.
These simplicity revolutions in the era of complexity have deep fundamental
reasons grounded in geometry of multidimensional data spaces. To explore and
understand these reasons we revisit the background ideas of statistical
physics. In the course of the 20th century they were developed into the
concentration of measure theory. New stochastic separation theorems reveal the
fine structure of the data clouds.
We review and analyse biological, physical, and mathematical problems at the
core of the fundamental question: how can high-dimensional brain organise
reliable and fast learning in high-dimensional world of data by simple tools?
Two critical applications are reviewed to exemplify the approach: one-shot
correction of errors in intellectual systems and emergence of static and

also be associated with healthy aging. MtDNA is stochastically replicated and
degraded, and exists within organelles which undergo dynamic fusion and
fission. The role of the resulting mitochondrial networks in determining the
time evolution of the cellular proportion of mutated mtDNA molecules
(heteroplasmy), and cell-to-cell variability in heteroplasmy (heteroplasmy
variance), remains incompletely understood. Heteroplasmy variance is
particularly important since it modulates the number of pathological cells in a
tissue. Here, we provide the first wide-reaching mathematical treatment which
bridges mitochondrial network and genetic states. We show that, for a range of
models, the rate of increase in heteroplasmy variance, and the rate of
\textit{de novo} mutation, is proportionately modulated by the fraction of
unfused mitochondria, independently of the absolute fission-fusion rate. In the
context of selective fusion, we show that intermediate fusion/fission ratios
are optimal for the clearance of mtDNA mutants. Our findings imply that
modulating network state, mitophagy rate and copy number to slow down
heteroplasmy dynamics when mean heteroplasmy is low, could have therapeutic
advantages for mitochondrial disease and healthy aging.

environment endowed with the capability to anticipate an upcoming environmental
change and undergo pre-emptive switching. By virtue of these anticipatory
transitions, the organism oscillates between its two states that is a time
$\theta$ out of sync with the environmental oscillation. We show that an
anticipation-capable organism increases its long-term fitness over an organism
that oscillates in-sync with the environment, provided $\theta$ does not exceed
a threshold. We also show that the long-term fitness is maximized for an
optimal anticipation time that decreases approximately as $1/n$, $n$ being the
number of cell divisions in time $T$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimal
""anticipators"" outperforms ""bet-hedgers"" in the range of parameters considered.
For a sub-optimal ensemble of anticipators, anticipation performs better to
bet-hedging only when the variance in anticipation is small compared to the
mean and the rate of pre-emptive transition is high. Taken together, our work
suggests that anticipation increases overall fitness of an organism in a
periodic environment and it is a viable alternative to bet-hedging provided the
error in anticipation is small.

Airbnb provides to its hosts. Furthermore, additional analysis is performed to
ascertain the likelihood of a listings availability for potential guests to
consider while making a booking. The analysis begins with exploring and
examining the data to make necessary transformations that can be conducive for
a better understanding of the problem at large while helping us make
hypothesis. Moving further, machine learning models are built that are
intuitive to use to validate the hypothesis on pricing and availability and run
experiments in that context to arrive at a viable solution. The paper then
concludes with a discussion on the business implications, associated risks and
future scope.

1291,The self-referring DNA and protein: a remark on physical and geometrical aspects,"  All known life forms are based upon a hierarchy of interwoven feedback loops,
operating over a cascade of space, time and energy scales. Among the most basic
loops are those connecting DNA and proteins. For example, in genetic networks,
DNA genes are expressed as proteins, which may bind near the same genes and
thereby control their own expression. In this molecular type of self-reference,
information is mapped from the DNA sequence to the protein and back to DNA.
There is a variety of dynamic DNA-protein self-reference loops, and the purpose
of this remark is to discuss certain geometrical and physical aspects related
to the back and forth mapping between DNA and proteins. The discussion raises
basic questions regarding the nature of DNA and proteins as self-referring
matter, which are examined in a simple toy model.

1292,Complexity of human response delay in intermittent control: The case of virtual stick balancing,"  Response delay is an inherent and essential part of human actions. In the
context of human balance control, the response delay is traditionally modeled
using the formalism of delay-differential equations, which adopts the
approximation of fixed delay. However, experimental studies revealing
substantial variability, adaptive anticipation, and non-stationary dynamics of
response delay provide evidence against this approximation. In this paper, we
call for development of principally new mathematical formalism describing human
response delay. To support this, we present the experimental data from a simple
virtual stick balancing task. Our results demonstrate that human response delay
is a widely distributed random variable with complex properties, which can
exhibit oscillatory and adaptive dynamics characterized by long-range
correlations. Given this, we argue that the fixed-delay approximation ignores
essential properties of human response, and conclude with possible directions
for future developments of new mathematical notions describing human control.

1293,Variable domain N-linked glycosylation and negative surface charge are key features of monoclonal ACPA: implications for B-cell selection,"  Autoreactive B cells have a central role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), and recent findings have proposed that anti-citrullinated
protein autoantibodies (ACPA) may be directly pathogenic. Herein, we
demonstrate the frequency of variable-region glycosylation in single-cell
cloned mAbs. A total of 14 ACPA mAbs were evaluated for predicted N-linked
glycosylation motifs in silico and compared to 452 highly-mutated mAbs from RA
patients and controls. Variable region N-linked motifs (N-X-S/T) were
strikingly prevalent within ACPA (100%) compared to somatically hypermutated
(SHM) RA bone marrow plasma cells (21%), and synovial plasma cells from
seropositive (39%) and seronegative RA (7%). When normalized for SHM, ACPA
still had significantly higher frequency of N-linked motifs compared to all
studied mAbs including highly-mutated HIV broadly-neutralizing and
malaria-associated mAbs. The Fab glycans of ACPA-mAbs were highly sialylated,
contributed to altered charge, but did not influence antigen binding. The
analysis revealed evidence of unusual B-cell selection pressure and
SHM-mediated decreased in surface charge and isoelectric point in ACPA. It is
still unknown how these distinct features of anti-citrulline immunity may have
an impact on pathogenesis. However, it is evident that they offer selective
advantages for ACPA+ B cells, possibly also through non-antigen driven
mechanisms.

additive market with prices of financial assets described by Markov additive
processes which combine LÃƒÂ©vy processes and regime switching models. Thus the
model takes into account two sources of risk: the jump diffusion risk and the
regime switching risk. For this reason the market is incomplete. We complete
the market by enlarging it with the use of a set of Markovian jump securities,
Markovian power-jump securities and impulse regime switching securities.
Moreover, we give conditions under which the market is
asymptotic-arbitrage-free. We solve the portfolio selection problem in the
ItÃƒÂ´-Markov additive market for the power utility and the logarithmic utility.

1295,Scalar Reduction of a Neural Field Model with Spike Frequency Adaptation,"  We study a deterministic version of a one- and two-dimensional attractor
neural network model of hippocampal activity first studied by Itskov et al
2011. We analyze the dynamics of the system on the ring and torus domain with
an even periodized weight matrix, assum- ing weak and slow spike frequency
adaptation and a weak stationary input current. On these domains, we find
transitions from spatially localized stationary solutions (""bumps"") to
(periodically modulated) solutions (""sloshers""), as well as constant and
non-constant velocity traveling bumps depending on the relative strength of
external input current and adaptation. The weak and slow adaptation allows for
a reduction of the system from a distributed partial integro-differential
equation to a system of scalar Volterra integro-differential equations
describing the movement of the centroid of the bump solution. Using this
reduction, we show that on both domains, sloshing solutions arise through an
Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and derive a normal form for the Hopf bifurcation on
the ring. We also show existence and stability of constant velocity solutions
on both domains using Evans functions. In contrast to existing studies, we
assume a general weight matrix of Mexican-hat type in addition to a smooth
firing rate function.

1296,Analysis of Sequence Polymorphism of LINEs and SINEs in Entamoeba histolytica,"  The goal of this dissertation is to study the sequence polymorphism in
retrotransposable elements of Entamoeba histolytica. The Quasispecies theory, a
concept of equilibrium (stationary), has been used to understand the behaviour
of these elements. Two datasets of retrotransposons of Entamoeba histolytica
have been used. We present results from both datasets of retrotransposons
(SINE1s) of E. histolytica. We have calculated the mutation rate of EhSINE1s
for both datasets and drawn a phylogenetic tree for newly determined EhSINE1s
(dataset II). We have also discussed the variation in lengths of EhSINE1s for
both datasets. Using the quasispecies model, we have shown how sequences of
SINE1s vary within the population. The outputs of the quasispecies model are
discussed in the presence and the absence of back mutation by taking different
values of fitness. From our study of Non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons
(LINEs and their non-autonomous partner's SINEs) of Entamoeba histolytica, we
can conclude that an active EhSINE can generate very similar copies of itself
by retrotransposition. Due to this reason, it increases mutations which give
the result of sequence polymorphism. We have concluded that the mutation rate
of SINE is very high. This high mutation rate provides an idea for the
existence of SINEs, which may affect the genetic analysis of EhSINE1
ancestries, and calculation of phylogenetic distances.

there is no perfect hedge. Here it is shown how various delta-type hedging
strategies perform and can be evaluated in such markets. A precise
characterization of the hedging cost, the replication cost caused by the
volatility fluctuations, is presented in an asymptotic regime of rapid mean
reversion for the volatility fluctuations. The optimal dynamic asset based
hedging strategy in the considered regime is identified as the so-called
`practitioners' delta hedging scheme. It is moreover shown that the
performances of the delta-type hedging schemes are essentially independent of
the regularity of the volatility paths in the considered regime and that the
hedging costs are related to a vega risk martingale whose magnitude is
proportional to a new market risk parameter.

system pre-Dini reform and post-Dini reform. The goal is to fill the gap
between the old and the new pension by joining a defined contribution pension
scheme and adopting an optimal investment strategy that is target-based. We
find that it is possible to cover, at least partially, this gap with the
additional income of the pension scheme, especially in the presence of late
retirement and in the presence of stagnant career. Workers with dynamic career
and workers who retire early are those who are most penalised by the reform.
Results are intuitive and in line with previous studies on the subject.

1300,Immigration-induced phase transition in a regulated multispecies birth-death process,"  Power-law-distributed species counts or clone counts arise in many biological
settings such as multispecies cell populations, population genetics, and
ecology. This empirical observation that the number of species $c_{k}$
represented by $k$ individuals scales as negative powers of $k$ is also
supported by a series of theoretical birth-death-immigration (BDI) models that
consistently predict many low-population species, a few intermediate-population
species, and very high-population species. However, we show how a simple global
population-dependent regulation in a neutral BDI model destroys the power law
distributions. Simulation of the regulated BDI model shows a high probability
of observing a high-population species that dominates the total population.
Further analysis reveals that the origin of this breakdown is associated with
the failure of a mean-field approximation for the expected species abundance
distribution. We find an accurate estimate for the expected distribution
$\langle c_k \rangle$ by mapping the problem to a lower-dimensional Moran
process, allowing us to also straightforwardly calculate the covariances
$\langle c_k c_\ell \rangle$. Finally, we exploit the concepts associated with
energy landscapes to explain the failure of the mean-field assumption by
identifying a phase transition in the quasi-steady-state species counts
triggered by a decreasing immigration rate.

1301,Fine-scale population structure analysis in Armadillidium vulgare (Isopoda: Oniscidea) reveals strong female philopatry,"  In the last decades, dispersal studies have benefitted from the use of
molecular markers for detecting patterns differing between categories of
individuals, and have highlighted sex-biased dispersal in several species. To
explain this phenomenon, sex-related handicaps such as parental care have been
recently proposed as a hypothesis. Herein we tested this hypothesis in
Armadillidium vulgare, a terrestrial isopod in which females bear the totality
of the high parental care costs. We performed a fine-scale analysis of
sex-specific dispersal patterns, using males and females originating from five
sampling points located within 70 meters of each other. Based on microsatellite
markers and both F-statistics and spatial autocorrelation analyses, our results
revealed that while males did not present a significant structure at this
geographic scale, females were significantly more similar to each other when
they were collected in the same sampling point. These results support the
sex-handicap hypothesis, and we suggest that widening dispersal studies to
other isopods or crustaceans, displaying varying levels of parental care but
differing in their ecology or mating system, might shed light on the processes
underlying the evolution of sex-biased dispersal.

1303,Evaluation of matrix factorisation approaches for muscle synergy extraction,"  The muscle synergy concept provides a widely-accepted paradigm to break down
the complexity of motor control. In order to identify the synergies, different
matrix factorisation techniques have been used in a repertoire of fields such
as prosthesis control and biomechanical and clinical studies. However, the
relevance of these matrix factorisation techniques is still open for discussion
since there is no ground truth for the underlying synergies. Here, we evaluate
factorisation techniques and investigate the factors that affect the quality of
estimated synergies. We compared commonly used matrix factorisation methods:
Principal component analysis (PCA), Independent component analysis (ICA),
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and second-order blind identification
(SOBI). Publicly available real data were used to assess the synergies
extracted by each factorisation method in the classification of wrist
movements. Synthetic datasets were utilised to explore the effect of muscle
synergy sparsity, level of noise and number of channels on the extracted
synergies. Results suggest that the sparse synergy model and a higher number of
channels would result in better-estimated synergies. Without dimensionality
reduction, SOBI showed better results than other factorisation methods. This
suggests that SOBI would be an alternative when a limited number of electrodes
is available but its performance was still poor in that case. Otherwise, NMF
had the best performance when the number of channels was higher than the number
of synergies. Therefore, NMF would be the best method for muscle synergy
extraction.

other methods of dealing with cancer. The Kirschner-Panetta (KP) model of
cancer immunotherapy describes the interaction between tumour cells, effector
cells and interleukin-2 which are clinically utilized as medical treatment. The

approximate analytical solutions to KP model are represented by using the
differential transform and Adomian decomposition. The complicated nonlinearity
of the KP system causes the application of these two methods to require more

with realistic examples using empirical data of product and process

1306,Zinc oxide induces the stringent response and major reorientations in the central metabolism of Bacillus subtilis,"  Microorganisms, such as bacteria, are one of the first targets of
nanoparticles in the environment. In this study, we tested the effect of two
nanoparticles, ZnO and TiO2, with the salt ZnSO4 as the control, on the
Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis by 2D gel electrophoresis-based
proteomics. Despite a significant effect on viability (LD50), TiO2 NPs had no
detectable effect on the proteomic pattern, while ZnO NPs and ZnSO4
significantly modified B. subtilis metabolism. These results allowed us to
conclude that the effects of ZnO observed in this work were mainly attributable
to Zn dissolution in the culture media. Proteomic analysis highlighted twelve
modulated proteins related to central metabolism: MetE and MccB (cysteine
metabolism), OdhA, AspB, IolD, AnsB, PdhB and YtsJ (Krebs cycle) and XylA,
YqjI, Drm and Tal (pentose phosphate pathway). Biochemical assays, such as free
sulfhydryl, CoA-SH and malate dehydrogenase assays corroborated the observed
central metabolism reorientation and showed that Zn stress induced oxidative
stress, probably as a consequence of thiol chelation stress by Zn ions. The
other patterns affected by ZnO and ZnSO4 were the stringent response and the
general stress response. Nine proteins involved in or controlled by the
stringent response showed a modified expression profile in the presence of ZnO
NPs or ZnSO4: YwaC, SigH, YtxH, YtzB, TufA, RplJ, RpsB, PdhB and Mbl. An
increase in the ppGpp concentration confirmed the involvement of the stringent
response during a Zn stress. All these metabolic reorientations in response to
Zn stress were probably the result of complex regulatory mechanisms including
at least the stringent response via YwaC.

1307,Asynchronous stochastic price pump,"  We propose a model for equity trading in a population of agents where each
agent acts to achieve his or her target stock-to-bond ratio, and, as a feedback
mechanism, follows a market adaptive strategy. In this model only a fraction of
agents participates in buying and selling stock during a trading period, while
the rest of the group accepts the newly set price. Using numerical simulations
we show that the stochastic process settles on a stationary regime for the
returns. The mean return can be greater or less than the return on the bond and
it is determined by the parameters of the adaptive mechanism. When the number
of interacting agents is fixed, the distribution of the returns follows the
log-normal density. In this case, we give an analytic formula for the mean rate
of return in terms of the rate of change of agents' risk levels and confirm the
formula by numerical simulations. However, when the number of interacting
agents per period is random, the distribution of returns can significantly
deviate from the log-normal, especially as the variance of the distribution for
the number of interacting agents increases.

1308,Fast Characterization of Segmental Duplications in Genome Assemblies,"  Segmental duplications (SDs), or low-copy repeats (LCR), are segments of DNA
greater than 1 Kbp with high sequence identity that are copied to other regions
of the genome. SDs are among the most important sources of evolution, a common
cause of genomic structural variation, and several are associated with diseases
of genomic origin. Despite their functional importance, SDs present one of the
major hurdles for de novo genome assembly due to the ambiguity they cause in
building and traversing both state-of-the-art overlap-layout-consensus and de
Bruijn graphs. This causes SD regions to be misassembled, collapsed into a
unique representation, or completely missing from assembled reference genomes
for various organisms. In turn, this missing or incorrect information limits
our ability to fully understand the evolution and the architecture of the
genomes. Despite the essential need to accurately characterize SDs in
assemblies, there is only one tool that has been developed for this purpose,
called Whole Genome Assembly Comparison (WGAC). WGAC is comprised of several
steps that employ different tools and custom scripts, which makes it difficult
and time consuming to use. Thus there is still a need for algorithms to
characterize within-assembly SDs quickly, accurately, and in a user friendly
manner.
Here we introduce a SEgmental Duplication Evaluation Framework (SEDEF) to
rapidly detect SDs through sophisticated filtering strategies based on Jaccard
similarity and local chaining. We show that SEDEF accurately detects SDs while
maintaining substantial speed up over WGAC that translates into practical run
times of minutes instead of weeks. Notably, our algorithm captures up to 25%
pairwise error between segments, where previous studies focused on only 10%,
allowing us to more deeply track the evolutionary history of the genome.

1309,Implementation of Control Strategies for Sterile Insect Techniques,"  In this paper, we propose a sex-structured entomological model that serves as
a basis for design of control strategies relying on releases of sterile male
mosquitoes (Aedes spp) and aiming at elimination of the wild vector population
in some target locality. We consider different types of releases (constant and
periodic impulsive), providing necessary conditions to reach elimination.
However, the main part of the paper is focused on the study of the periodic
impulsive control in different situations. When the size of wild mosquito
population cannot be assessed in real time, we propose the so-called open-loop
control strategy that relies on periodic impulsive releases of sterile males
with constant release size. Under this control mode, global convergence towards
the mosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of sufficient condition
that relates the size and frequency of releases. If periodic assessments
(either synchronized with releases or more sparse) of the wild population size
are available in real time, we propose the so-called closed-loop control
strategy, which is adjustable in accordance with reliable estimations of the
wild population sizes. Under this control mode, global convergence to the
mosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of another sufficient
condition that relates not only the size and frequency of periodic releases but
also the frequency of sparse measurements taken on wild populations. Finally,
we propose a mixed control strategy that combines open-loop and closed-loop
strategies. This control mode renders the best result, in terms of overall time
needed to reach elimination and the number of releases to be effectively
carried out during the whole release campaign, while requiring for a reasonable
amount of released sterile insects.

sensitivity by means of multi-modal attention-based neural networks (PaccMann).
In our approach, we integrate three key pillars of drug sensitivity, namely,
the molecular structure of compounds, transcriptomic profiles of cancer cells
as well as prior knowledge about interactions among proteins within cells. Our
models ingest a drug-cell pair consisting of SMILES encoding of a compound and
the gene expression profile of a cancer cell and predicts an IC50 sensitivity
value. Gene expression profiles are encoded using an attention-based encoding
mechanism that assigns high weights to the most informative genes. We present
and study three encoders for SMILES string of compounds: 1) bidirectional
recurrent 2) convolutional 3) attention-based encoders. We compare our devised
models against a baseline model that ingests engineered fingerprints to
represent the molecular structure. We demonstrate that using our
attention-based encoders, we can surpass the baseline model. The use of
attention-based encoders enhance interpretability and enable us to identify
genes, bonds and atoms that were used by the network to make a prediction.

can be organized as a higher order tensor. Low-rank tensor decomposition then
arises as a powerful and widely used tool to discover simple low dimensional
structures underlying such data. However, we currently lack a theoretical
understanding of the algorithmic behavior of low-rank tensor decompositions. We
derive Bayesian approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms for recovering
arbitrarily shaped low-rank tensors buried within noise, and we employ dynamic
mean field theory to precisely characterize their performance. Our theory
reveals the existence of phase transitions between easy, hard and impossible
inference regimes, and displays an excellent match with simulations. Moreover,
it reveals several qualitative surprises compared to the behavior of symmetric,
cubic tensor decomposition. Finally, we compare our AMP algorithm to the most
commonly used algorithm, alternating least squares (ALS), and demonstrate that
AMP significantly outperforms ALS in the presence of noise.

length distribution functions of short DNA molecules described by a mesoscopic
Hamiltonian. The method generates a large statistical ensemble of possible
configurations for each dimer in the sequence, selects the global equilibrium
twist conformation for the molecule and determines the average base pair
distances along the molecule backbone. Integrating over the base pair radial
and angular fluctuations, we derive the room temperature distribution functions
as a function of the sequence length. The obtained values for the most probable
end-to-end distance and contour length distance, providing a measure of the
global molecule size, are used to examine the DNA flexibility at short length
scales. It is found that, also in molecules with less than $\sim 60$ base
pairs, coiled configurations maintain a large statistical weight and,
consistently, the persistence lengths may be much smaller than in kilo-base

contraction of cardiac muscle, featuring different thermo-electric and
nonlinear conductivity properties. The passive hyperelastic response of the
tissue is described by an orthotropic exponential model, whereas the ionic
activity dictates active contraction incorporated through the concept of
orthotropic active strain. We use a fully incompressible formulation, and the
generated strain modifies directly the conductivity mechanisms in the medium
through the pull-back transformation. We also investigate the influence of
thermo-electric effects in the onset of multiphysics emergent spatiotemporal
dynamics, using nonlinear diffusion. It turns out that these ingredients have a
key role in reproducing pathological chaotic dynamics such as ventricular
fibrillation during inflammatory events, for instance. The specific structure
of the governing equations suggests to cast the problem in mixed-primal form
and we write it in terms of Kirchhoff stress, displacements, solid pressure,
electric potential, activation generation, and ionic variables. We also propose
a new mixed-primal finite element method for its numerical approximation, and
we use it to explore the properties of the model and to assess the importance
of coupling terms, by means of a few computational experiments in 3D.

transform rather than the routinely used Legendre transform. We apply this
analysis to studying time series consisting of inter-event times. As a result,
we discern the non-monotonic behavior of the generalized Hurst exponent - the
fundamental exponent studied by us - and hence a multi-branched left-sided
spectrum of dimensions. This kind of multifractality is a direct result of the
non-monotonic behavior of the generalized Hurst exponent and is not caused by
non-analytic behavior as has been previously suggested. We examine the main
thermodynamic consequences of the existence of this type of multifractality
related to the thermal stable, metastable, and unstable phases within a
hierarchy of fluctuations, and also to the first and second order phase
transitions between them.

1317,Quantifying the Model Risk Inherent in the Calibration and Recalibration of Option Pricing Models,"  We focus on two particular aspects of model risk: the inability of a chosen
model to fit observed market prices at a given point in time (calibration
error) and the model risk due to recalibration of model parameters (in
contradiction to the model assumptions). In this context, we follow the
approach of Glasserman and Xu (2014) and use relative entropy as a pre-metric
in order to quantify these two sources of model risk in a common framework, and
consider the trade-offs between them when choosing a model and the frequency
with which to recalibrate to the market. We illustrate this approach applied to
the models of Black and Scholes (1973) and Heston (1993), using option data for
Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG). We find that recalibrating a model more
frequently simply shifts model risk from one type to another, without any
substantial reduction of aggregate model risk. Furthermore, moving to a more
complicated stochastic model is seen to be counterproductive if one requires a
high degree of robustness, for example as quantified by a 99 percent quantile
of aggregate model risk.

understanding how nucleic acid information is propagated and used by living
systems to create complex biomolecules. Here, by integrating the structural and
dynamic paradigms of DNA nanotechnology, we present a rationally designed
synthetic platform which functions in an analogous manner to create complex DNA
nanostructures. Starting from one type of DNA nanostructure, DNA strand
displacement circuits were designed to interact and pass along the information
encoded in the initial structure to mediate the self-assembly of a different
type of structure, the final output structure depending on the type of circuit
triggered. Using this concept of a DNA structure ""trans-assembling"" a different
DNA structure through non-local strand displacement circuitry, four different
schemes were implemented. Specifically, 1D ladder and 2D double-crossover (DX)
lattices were designed to kinetically trigger DNA circuits to activate
polymerization of either ring structures or another type of DX lattice under
enzyme-free, isothermal conditions. In each scheme, the desired multilayer
reaction pathway was activated, among multiple possible pathways, ultimately
leading to the downstream self-assembly of the correct output structure.

1320,Finite size effects for spiking neural networks with spatially dependent coupling,"  We study finite-size fluctuations in a network of spiking deterministic
neurons coupled with non-uniform synaptic coupling. We generalize a previously
developed theory of finite size effects for uniform globally coupled neurons.
In the uniform case, mean field theory is well defined by averaging over the
network as the number of neurons in the network goes to infinity. However, for
nonuniform coupling it is no longer possible to average over the entire network
if we are interested in fluctuations at a particular location within the
network. We show that if the coupling function approaches a continuous function
in the infinite system size limit then an average over a local neighborhood can
be defined such that mean field theory is well defined for a spatially
dependent field. We then derive a perturbation expansion in the inverse system
size around the mean field limit for the covariance of the input to a neuron
(synaptic drive) and firing rate fluctuations due to dynamical deterministic
finite-size effects.

adversary of robust risk management. The proposed approach accounts for all
alternative models and incorporates the economic reality of the fictitious
adversary. It provides practically feasible results that overcome the
restriction and the integrability issue imposed by the nominal model. The
Wasserstein approach suits for all types of model risk problems, ranging from
the single-asset hedging risk problem to the multi-asset allocation problem.
The robust capital allocation line, accounting for the correlation risk, is not
achievable with other non-parametric approaches.

1322,Fixed points of competitive threshold-linear networks,"  Threshold-linear networks (TLNs) are models of neural networks that consist
of simple, perceptron-like neurons and exhibit nonlinear dynamics that are
determined by the network's connectivity. The fixed points of a TLN, including
both stable and unstable equilibria, play a critical role in shaping its
emergent dynamics. In this work, we provide two novel characterizations for the
set of fixed points of a competitive TLN: the first is in terms of a simple
sign condition, while the second relies on the concept of domination. We apply
these results to a special family of TLNs, called combinatorial
threshold-linear networks (CTLNs), whose connectivity matrices are defined from
directed graphs. This leads us to prove a series of graph rules that enable one
to determine fixed points of a CTLN by analyzing the underlying graph.
Additionally, we study larger networks composed of smaller ""building block""
subnetworks, and prove several theorems relating the fixed points of the full
network to those of its components. Our results provide the foundation for a
kind of ""graphical calculus"" to infer features of the dynamics from a network's
connectivity.

price (VWAP) benchmark when the market impact is linear and transient. Our
setting is indeed more general as it considers the case when the trading
interval is not necessarily coincident with the benchmark interval:
Implementation Shortfall and Target Close execution are shown to be particular
cases of our setting. We find explicit solutions in continuous and discrete
time considering risk averse investors having a CARA utility function. Finally,
we show that, contrary to what is observed for Implementation Shortfall, the
optimal VWAP solution contains both buy and sell trades also when the decay
kernel is convex.

1324,Error Forward-Propagation: Reusing Feedforward Connections to Propagate Errors in Deep Learning,"  We introduce Error Forward-Propagation, a biologically plausible mechanism to
propagate error feedback forward through the network. Architectural constraints
on connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain;
systematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error
feedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the
forward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be
used in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment
problem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly
successful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks.
Backpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron.
From a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural
constraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain.
This architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback
weights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity
patterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal
connections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural
constraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error
feedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error
feedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer. This mechanism,
Error Forward-Propagation, is a plausible basis for how error feedback occurs
deep in the brain independent of and yet in support of the functionality
underlying intricate network architectures. We show experimentally that
recurrent neural networks with two and three hidden layers can be trained using
Error Forward-Propagation on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving
$1.90\%$ and $11\%$ generalization errors respectively.

1325,The Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping of the Human Hippocampus Shows Much More Frequent Neighbor Sets in Males Than in Females,"  In the study of the human connectome, the vertices and the edges of the
network of the human brain are analyzed: the vertices of the graphs are the
anatomically identified gray matter areas of the subjects; this set is exactly
the same for all the subjects. The edges of the graphs correspond to the axonal
fibers, connecting these areas. In the biological applications of graph theory,
it happens very rarely that scientists examine numerous large graphs on the
very same, labeled vertex set. Exactly this is the case in the study of the
connectomes. Because of the particularity of these sets of graphs, novel,
robust methods need to be developed for their analysis. Here we introduce the
new method of the Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping for the connectome,
which serves as a robust identification of the neighborhoods of given vertices
of special interest in the graph. We apply the novel method for mapping the
neighborhoods of the human hippocampus and discover strong statistical
asymmetries between the connectomes of the sexes, computed from the Human
Connectome Project. We analyze 413 braingraphs, each with 463 nodes. We show
that the hippocampi of men have much more significantly frequent neighbor sets
than women; therefore, in a sense, the connections of the hippocampi are more
regularly distributed in men and more varied in women. Our results are in
contrast to the volumetric studies of the human hippocampus, where it was shown
that the relative volume of the hippocampus is the same in men and women.

1326,"A mechanistic model of connector hubs, modularity, and cognition","  The human brain network is modular--comprised of communities of tightly
interconnected nodes. This network contains local hubs, which have many
connections within their own communities, and connector hubs, which have
connections diversely distributed across communities. A mechanistic
understanding of these hubs and how they support cognition has not been
demonstrated. Here, we leveraged individual differences in hub connectivity and
cognition. We show that a model of hub connectivity accurately predicts the
cognitive performance of 476 individuals in four distinct tasks. Moreover,
there is a general optimal network structure for cognitive
performance--individuals with diversely connected hubs and consequent modular
brain networks exhibit increased cognitive performance, regardless of the task.
Critically, we find evidence consistent with a mechanistic model in which
connector hubs tune the connectivity of their neighbors to be more modular
while allowing for task appropriate information integration across communities,
which increases global modularity and cognitive performance.

1327,Portfolio Optimization under Fast Mean-reverting and Rough Fractional Stochastic Environment,"  Fractional stochastic volatility models have been widely used to capture the
non-Markovian structure revealed from financial time series of realized
volatility. On the other hand, empirical studies have identified scales in
stock price volatility: both fast-time scale on the order of days and
slow-scale on the order of months. So, it is natural to study the portfolio
optimization problem under the effects of dependence behavior which we will
model by fractional Brownian motions with Hurst index $H$, and in the fast or
slow regimes characterized by small parameters $\eps$ or $\delta$. For the
slowly varying volatility with $H \in (0,1)$, it was shown that the first order
correction to the problem value contains two terms of order $\delta^H$, one
random component and one deterministic function of state processes, while for
the fast varying case with $H > \half$, the same form holds at order
$\eps^{1-H}$. This paper is dedicated to the remaining case of a fast-varying
rough environment ($H < \half$) which exhibits a different behavior. We show
that, in the expansion, only one deterministic term of order $\sqrt{\eps}$
appears in the first order correction.

1328,Doing good vs. avoiding bad in prosocial choice: A refined test and extension of the morality preference hypothesis,"  Prosociality is fundamental to human social life, and, accordingly, much
research has attempted to explain human prosocial behavior. Capraro and Rand
(Judgment and Decision Making, 13, 99-111, 2018) recently provided experimental
evidence that prosociality in anonymous, one-shot interactions (such as
Prisoner's Dilemma and Dictator Game experiments) is not driven by
outcome-based social preferences - as classically assumed - but by a
generalized morality preference for ""doing the right thing"". Here we argue that
the key experiments reported in Capraro and Rand (2018) comprise prominent
methodological confounds and open questions that bear on influential
psychological theory. Specifically, their design confounds: (i) preferences for
efficiency with self-interest; and (ii) preferences for action with preferences
for morality. Furthermore, their design fails to dissociate the preference to
do ""good"" from the preference to avoid doing ""bad"". We thus designed and
conducted a preregistered, refined and extended test of the morality preference
hypothesis (N=801). Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that
prosociality in the anonymous, one-shot Dictator Game is driven by preferences
for doing the morally right thing. Inconsistent with influential psychological
theory, however, our results suggest the preference to do ""good"" was as potent
as the preference to avoid doing ""bad"" in this case.

1329,Finding influential nodes for integration in brain networks using optimal percolation theory,"  Global integration of information in the brain results from complex
interactions of segregated brain networks. Identifying the most influential
neuronal populations that efficiently bind these networks is a fundamental
problem of systems neuroscience. Here we apply optimal percolation theory and
pharmacogenetic interventions in-vivo to predict and subsequently target nodes
that are essential for global integration of a memory network in rodents. The
theory predicts that integration in the memory network is mediated by a set of
low-degree nodes located in the nucleus accumbens. This result is confirmed
with pharmacogenetic inactivation of the nucleus accumbens, which eliminates
the formation of the memory network, while inactivations of other brain areas
leave the network intact. Thus, optimal percolation theory predicts essential
nodes in brain networks. This could be used to identify targets of
interventions to modulate brain function.

1330,A Game of Martingales,"  We consider a two player dynamic game played over $T \leq \infty$ periods. In
each period each player chooses any probability distribution with support on
$[0,1]$ with a given mean, where the mean is the realized value of the draw
from the previous period. The player with the highest realization in the period
achieves a payoff of $1$, and the other player, $0$; and each player seeks to
maximize the discounted sum of his per-period payoffs over the whole time
horizon. We solve for the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of this game, and
establish properties of the equilibrium strategies and payoffs in the limit.
The solution and comparative statics thereof provide insight about
intertemporal choice with status concerns. In particular we find that patient
players take fewer risks.

1331,Frictional Effects on RNA Folding: Speed Limit and Kramers Turnover,"  We investigated frictional effects on the folding rates of a human telomerase
hairpin (hTR HP) and H-type pseudoknot from the Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV
PK) using simulations of the Three Interaction Site (TIS) model for RNA. The
heat capacity from TIS model simulations, calculated using temperature replica
exchange simulations, reproduces nearly quantitatively the available
experimental data for the hTR HP. The corresponding results for BWYV PK serve
as predictions. We calculated the folding rates ($k_\mathrm{F}$) from more than
100 folding trajectories for each value of the solvent viscosity ($\eta$) at a
fixed salt concentration of 200 mM. By using the theoretical estimate
($\propto$$\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of nucleotides) for folding free
energy barrier, $k_\mathrm{F}$ data for both the RNAs are quantitatively fit
using one-dimensional Kramers' theory with two parameters specifying the
curvatures in the unfolded basin and the barrier top. In the high-friction
regime ($\eta\gtrsim10^{-5}\,\textrm{Pa\ensuremath{\cdot}s}$), for both HP and
PK, $k_\mathrm{F}$s decrease as $1/\eta$ whereas in the low friction regime,
$k_\mathrm{F}$ values increase as $\eta$ increases, leading to a maximum
folding rate at a moderate viscosity
($\sim10^{-6}\,\textrm{Pa\ensuremath{\cdot}s}$), which is the Kramers turnover.
From the fits, we find that the speed limit to RNA folding at water viscosity
is between 1 and 4 $\mathrm{\mu s}$, which is in accord with our previous
theoretical prediction as well as results from several single molecule
experiments. Both the RNA constructs fold by parallel pathways. Surprisingly,
we find that the flux through the pathways could be altered by changing solvent
viscosity, a prediction that is more easily testable in RNA than in proteins.

phase transition from a flowing to jammed state as they age. Here we report
experiments and numerical simulations illustrating how a jammed cellular layer
rapidly reverts to a flowing state after a wound. Quantitative comparison
between experiments and simulations shows that cells change their
self-propulsion and alignement strength so that the system crosses a phase
transition line, which we characterize by finite-size scaling in an active
particle model. This wound-induced unjamming transition is found to occur
generically in epithelial, endothelial and cancer cells.

1333,A Critical-like Collective State Leads to Long-range Cell Communication in Dictyostelium discoideum Aggregation,"  The transition from single-cell to multicellular behavior is important in
early development but rarely studied. The starvation-induced aggregation of the
social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum into a multicellular slug is known to
result from single-cell chemotaxis towards emitted pulses of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP). However, how exactly do transient short-range chemical
gradients lead to coherent collective movement at a macroscopic scale? Here, we
use a multiscale model verified by quantitative microscopy to describe
wide-ranging behaviors from chemotaxis and excitability of individual cells to
aggregation of thousands of cells. To better understand the mechanism of
long-range cell-cell communication and hence aggregation, we analyze cell-cell
correlations, showing evidence for self-organization at the onset of
aggregation (as opposed to following a leader cell). Surprisingly, cell
collectives, despite their finite size, show features of criticality known from
phase transitions in physical systems. Application of external cAMP
perturbations in our simulations near the sensitive critical point allows
steering cells into early aggregation and towards certain locations but not
once an aggregation center has been chosen.

1334,Investor Reaction to Financial Disclosures Across Topics: An Application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation,"  This paper provides a holistic study of how stock prices vary in their
response to financial disclosures across different topics. Thereby, we
specifically shed light into the extensive amount of filings for which no a
priori categorization of their content exists. For this purpose, we utilize an
approach from data mining - namely, latent Dirichlet allocation - as a means of
topic modeling. This technique facilitates our task of automatically
categorizing, ex ante, the content of more than 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings
from U.S. companies. We then evaluate the subsequent stock market reaction. Our
empirical evidence suggests a considerable discrepancy among various types of
news stories in terms of their relevance and impact on financial markets. For
instance, we find a statistically significant abnormal return in response to
earnings results and credit rating, but also for disclosures regarding business
strategy, the health sector, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Our results
yield findings that benefit managers, investors and policy-makers by indicating
how regulatory filings should be structured and the topics most likely to
precede changes in stock valuations.

1335,Calibration for Weak Variance-Alpha-Gamma Processes,"  The weak variance-alpha-gamma process is a multivariate LÃƒÂ©vy process
constructed by weakly subordinating Brownian motion, possibly with correlated
components with an alpha-gamma subordinator. It generalises the
variance-alpha-gamma process of Semeraro constructed by traditional
subordination. We compare three calibration methods for the weak
variance-alpha-gamma process, method of moments, maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) and digital moment estimation (DME). We derive a condition for Fourier
invertibility needed to apply MLE and show in our simulations that MLE produces
a better fit when this condition holds, while DME produces a better fit when it
is violated. We also find that the weak variance-alpha-gamma process exhibits a
wider range of dependence and produces a significantly better fit than the
variance-alpha-gamma process on an S&P500-FTSE100 data set, and that DME
produces the best fit in this situation.

1336,A framework for cost-constrained genome rearrangement under Double Cut and Join,"  The study of genome rearrangement has many flavours, but they all are somehow
tied to edit distances on variations of a multi-graph called the breakpoint
graph. We study a weighted 2-break distance on Eulerian 2-edge-colored
multi-graphs, which generalizes weighted versions of several Double Cut and
Join problems, including those on genomes with unequal gene content. We affirm
the connection between cycle decompositions and edit scenarios first discovered
with the Sorting By Reversals problem. Using this we show that the problem of
finding a parsimonious scenario of minimum cost on an Eulerian 2-edge-colored
multi-graph - with a general cost function for 2-breaks - can be solved by
decomposing the problem into independent instances on simple alternating
cycles. For breakpoint graphs, and a more constrained cost function, based on
coloring the vertices, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a
parsimonious 2-break scenario of minimum cost, while showing that finding a
non-parsimonious 2-break scenario of minimum cost is NP-Hard.

1337,Measuring Systematic Risk with Neural Network Factor Model,"  In this paper, we measure systematic risk with a new nonparametric factor
model, the neural network factor model. The suitable factors for systematic
risk can be naturally found by inserting daily returns on a wide range of
assets into the bottleneck network. The network-based model does not stick to a
probabilistic structure unlike parametric factor models, and it does not need
feature engineering because it selects notable features by itself. In addition,
we compare performance between our model and the existing models using 20-year
data of S&P 100 components. Although the new model can not outperform the best
ones among the parametric factor models due to limitations of the variational
inference, the estimation method used for this study, it is still noteworthy in
that it achieves the performance as best the comparable models could without
any prior knowledge.

1339,"Cross-Sectional Variation of Intraday Liquidity, Cross-Impact, and their Effect on Portfolio Execution","  The composition of natural liquidity has been changing over time. An analysis
of intraday volumes for the S&P500 constituent stocks illustrates that (i)
volume surprises, i.e., deviations from their respective forecasts, are
correlated across stocks, and (ii) this correlation increases during the last
few hours of the trading session. These observations could be attributed, in
part, to the prevalence of portfolio trading activity that is implicit in the
growth of ETF, passive and systematic investment strategies; and, to the
increased trading intensity of such strategies towards the end of the trading
session, e.g., due to execution of mutual fund inflows/outflows that are
benchmarked to the closing price on each day. In this paper, we investigate the
consequences of such portfolio liquidity on price impact and portfolio
execution. We derive a linear cross-asset market impact from a stylized model
that explicitly captures the fact that a certain fraction of natural liquidity
providers only trade portfolios of stocks whenever they choose to execute. We
find that due to cross-impact and its intraday variation, it is optimal for a
risk-neutral, cost minimizing liquidator to execute a portfolio of orders in a
coupled manner, as opposed to a separable VWAP-like execution that is often
assumed. The optimal schedule couples the execution of the various orders so as
to be able to take advantage of increased portfolio liquidity towards the end
of the day. A worst case analysis shows that the potential cost reduction from
this optimized execution schedule over the separable approach can be as high as
6% for plausible model parameters. Finally, we discuss how to estimate
cross-sectional price impact if one had a dataset of realized portfolio
transaction records that exploits the low-rank structure of its coefficient
matrix suggested by our analysis.

1340,Bivariate Causal Discovery and its Applications to Gene Expression and Imaging Data Analysis,"  The mainstream of research in genetics, epigenetics and imaging data analysis
focuses on statistical association or exploring statistical dependence between
variables. Despite their significant progresses in genetic research,
understanding the etiology and mechanism of complex phenotypes remains elusive.
Using association analysis as a major analytical platform for the complex data
analysis is a key issue that hampers the theoretic development of genomic
science and its application in practice. Causal inference is an essential
component for the discovery of mechanical relationships among complex
phenotypes. Many researchers suggest making the transition from association to
causation. Despite its fundamental role in science, engineering and
biomedicine, the traditional methods for causal inference require at least
three variables. However, quantitative genetic analysis such as QTL, eQTL,
mQTL, and genomic-imaging data analysis requires exploring the causal
relationships between two variables. This paper will focus on bivariate causal
discovery. We will introduce independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) as a
basic principle for causal inference, algorithmic information theory and
additive noise model (ANM) as major tools for bivariate causal discovery.
Large-scale simulations will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of the
ANM for bivariate causal discovery. To further evaluate their performance for
causal inference, the ANM will be applied to the construction of gene
regulatory networks. Also, the ANM will be applied to trait-imaging data
analysis to illustrate three scenarios: presence of both causation and
association, presence of association while absence of causation, and presence
of causation, while lack of association between two variables.

1341,How production networks amplify economic growth,"  Technological improvement is the most important cause of long-term economic
growth, but the factors that drive it are still not fully understood. In
standard growth models technology is treated in the aggregate, and a main goal
has been to understand how growth depends on factors such as knowledge
production. But an economy can also be viewed as a network, in which producers
purchase goods, convert them to new goods, and sell them to households or other
producers. Here we develop a simple theory that shows how the network
properties of an economy can amplify the effects of technological improvements
as they propagate along chains of production. A key property of an industry is
its output multiplier, which can be understood as the average number of
production steps required to make a good. The model predicts that the output
multiplier of an industry predicts future changes in prices, and that the
average output multiplier of a country predicts future economic growth. We test
these predictions using data from the World Input Output Database and find
results in good agreement with the model. The results show how purely
structural properties of an economy, that have nothing to do with innovation or
human creativity, can exert an important influence on long-term growth.

experimental design. Several methods for gamma-turn prediction have been
developed, but the results were unsatisfactory with Matthew correlation
coefficients (MCC) around 0.2-0.4. One reason for the low prediction accuracy
is the limited capacity of the methods; in particular, the traditional
machine-learning methods like SVM may not extract high-level features well to
distinguish between turn or non-turn. Hence, it is worthwhile exploring new
machine-learning methods for the prediction. A cutting-edge deep neural
network, named Capsule Network (CapsuleNet), provides a new opportunity for
gamma-turn prediction. Even when the number of input samples is relatively
small, the capsules from CapsuleNet are very effective to extract high-level
features for classification tasks. Here, we propose a deep inception capsule
network for gamma-turn prediction. Its performance on the gamma-turn benchmark
GT320 achieved an MCC of 0.45, which significantly outperformed the previous
best method with an MCC of 0.38. This is the first gamma-turn prediction method
utilizing deep neural networks. Also, to our knowledge, it is the first
published bioinformatics application utilizing capsule network, which will
provides a useful example for the community.

1343,Quantification of market efficiency based on informational-entropy,"  Since the 1960s, the question whether markets are efficient or not is
controversially discussed. One reason for the difficulty to overcome the
controversy is the lack of a universal, but also precise, quantitative
definition of efficiency that is able to graduate between different states of
efficiency. The main purpose of this article is to fill this gap by developing
a measure for the efficiency of markets that fulfill all the stated
requirements. It is shown that the new definition of efficiency, based on
informational-entropy, is equivalent to the two most used definitions of
efficiency from Fama and Jensen. The new measure therefore enables steps to
settle the dispute over the state of efficiency in markets. Moreover, it is
shown that inefficiency in a market can either arise from the possibility to
use information to predict an event with higher than chance level, or can
emerge from wrong pricing/ quotes that do not reflect the right probabilities
of possible events. Finally, the calculation of efficiency is demonstrated on a
simple game (of coin tossing), to show how one could exactly quantify the
efficiency in any market-like system, if all probabilities are known.

applications of CAP in cancer therapy. In this paper, uCAP devices with
different nozzle lengths were applied to investigate effects on both brain

different lengths such as potential distribution, electron density, and optical
emission spectroscopy. The generation of short- and long-lived species (such as
hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrite
(NO2-), et al) were studied. These data revealed that uCAP treatment with a 20
mm length tube has a stronger effect than that of the 60 mm tube due to the
synergetic effects of reactive species and free radicals. Reactive species
generated by uCAP enhanced tumor cell death in a dose-dependent fashion and was
not specific with regards to tumor cell type.

adoption of ANNs, such as DNN and CNN, in many real-world applications.
However, the underlying massive amounts of computation and storage requirement
greatly challenge their applicability in resource-limited platforms like the
drone, mobile phone, and IoT devices etc. The third generation of neural
network model--Spiking Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the working mechanism
and efficiency of human brain, has emerged as a promising solution for
achieving more impressive computing and power efficiency within light-weighted
devices (e.g. single chip). However, the relevant research activities have been
narrowly carried out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for
fulfilling the practical cognitive tasks, underestimating SNN's energy
efficiency, throughput, and system flexibility. Although the time-based SNN can
be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic
applications due to lack of efficient coding and practical learning schemes. In
this work, a Precise-Time-Dependent Single Spike Neuromorphic Architecture,
namely ""PT-Spike"", is developed to bridge this gap. Three constituent
hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding,
efficient supervised temporal learning, and fast asymmetric decoding are
proposed accordingly to boost the energy efficiency and data processing
capability of the time-based SNN at a more compact neural network model size
when executing real cognitive tasks. Simulation results show that ""PT-Spike""
demonstrates significant improvements in network size, processing efficiency
and power consumption with marginal classification accuracy degradation when
compared with the rate-based SNN and ANN under the similar network
configuration.

the community, but the relative importance of transmission in each setting is
unknown. We developed a mathematical model of C. difficile transmission in a
hospital and surrounding community that included infants, adults, and
transmission from animal reservoirs. We assessed the role of these transmission
routes in maintaining disease and evaluated the recommended classification
system for hospital and community-acquired CDIs. The reproduction number in the
hospital was <1 (range: 0.16-0.46) for all scenarios. Outside the hospital, the
reproduction number was >1 for nearly all scenarios without transmission from
animal reservoirs (range: 1.0-1.34). However, the reproduction number for the
human population was <1 if a minority (>3.5-26.0%) of human exposures
originated from animal reservoirs. Symptomatic adults accounted for <10%
transmission in the community. Under conservative assumptions, infants
accounted for 17% of community transmission. An estimated 33-40% of
community-acquired cases were reported but 28-39% of these reported cases were
misclassified as hospital-acquired by recommended definitions. Transmission
could be plausibly sustained by asymptomatically colonized adults and infants
in the community or exposure to animal reservoirs, but not hospital
transmission alone. Underreporting of community-onset cases and systematic
misclassification underplays the role of community transmission.

are very challenging to understand from a statistical mechanics perspective.
While statistical treatments of evolutionary biological systems have a long and
rich history, examination of the time-dependent non-equilibrium dynamics has
been less studied. In this paper we first derive a generalized master equation
in the genotype space for diploid organisms incorporating the processes of
selection, mutation, recombination, and reproduction. The master equation is
defined in terms of continuous time and can handle an arbitrary number of gene
loci and alleles, and can be defined in terms of an absolute population or
probabilities. We examine and analytically solve several prototypical cases
which illustrate the interplay of the various processes and discuss the
timescales of their evolution. The entropy production during the evolution
towards steady state is calculated and we find that it agrees with predictions
from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics where it is large when the
population distribution evolves towards a more viable genotype. The stability
of the non-equilibrium steady state is confirmed using the Glansdorff-Prigogine
criterion.

1348,Burst Synchronization in A Scale-Free Neuronal Network with Inhibitory Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity,"  We are concerned about burst synchronization (BS), related to neural
information processes in health and disease, in the BarabÃƒÂ¡si-Albert
scale-free network (SFN) composed of inhibitory bursting Hindmarsh-Rose
neurons. This inhibitory neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic
strengths governed by the inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP).
In previous works without considering iSTDP, BS was found to appear in a range
of noise intensities for fixed synaptic inhibition strengths. In contrast, in
our present work, we take into consideration iSTDP and investigate its effect
on BS by varying the noise intensity. Our new main result is to find occurrence
of a Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity: good BS gets better via
LTD, while bad BS get worse via LTP. This kind of Matthew effect in inhibitory
synaptic plasticity is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity
where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). We note
that, due to inhibition, the roles of LTD and LTP in inhibitory synaptic
plasticity are reversed in comparison with those in excitatory synaptic
plasticity. Moreover, emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition
strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the
distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic burst onset
times. Finally, in the presence of iSTDP we investigate the effects of network
architecture on BS by varying the symmetric attachment degree $l^*$ and the
asymmetry parameter $\Delta l$ in the SFN.

1349,Neural correlates of episodic memory in the Memento cohort,"  IntroductionThe free and cued selective reminding test is used to identify
memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment and demented patients. It allows
assessing three processes: encoding, storage, and recollection of verbal
episodic memory.MethodsWe investigated the neural correlates of these three
memory processes in a large cohort study. The Memento cohort enrolled 2323
outpatients presenting either with subjective cognitive decline or mild
cognitive impairment who underwent cognitive, structural MRI and, for a subset,
fluorodeoxyglucose--positron emission tomography evaluations.ResultsEncoding
was associated with a network including parietal and temporal cortices; storage
was mainly associated with entorhinal and parahippocampal regions, bilaterally;
retrieval was associated with a widespread network encompassing frontal
regions.DiscussionThe neural correlates of episodic memory processes can be
assessed in large and standardized cohorts of patients at risk for Alzheimer's
disease. Their relation to pathophysiological markers of Alzheimer's disease
remains to be studied.

1350,Corruption-free scheme of entering into contract: mathematical model,"  The main purpose of this paper is to formalize the modelling process,
analysis and mathematical definition of corruption when entering into a
contract between principal agent and producers. The formulation of the problem
and the definition of concepts for the general case are considered. For
definiteness, all calculations and formulas are given for the case of three
producers, one principal agent and one intermediary. Economic analysis of
corruption allowed building a mathematical model of interaction between agents.
Financial resources distribution problem in a contract with a corrupted
intermediary is considered.Then proposed conditions for corruption emergence
and its possible consequences. Optimal non-corruption schemes of financial
resources distribution in a contract are formed, when principal agent's choice
is limited first only by asymmetrical information and then also by external
influences.Numerical examples suggesting optimal corruption-free agents'
behaviour are presented.

1351,Non-Gaussian Stochastic Volatility Model with Jumps via Gibbs Sampler,"  In this work, we propose a model for estimating volatility from financial
time series, extending the non-Gaussian family of space-state models with exact
marginal likelihood proposed by Gamerman, Santos and Franco (2013). On the
literature there are models focused on estimating financial assets risk,
however, most of them rely on MCMC methods based on Metropolis algorithms,
since full conditional posterior distributions are not known. We present an
alternative model capable of estimating the volatility, in an automatic way,
since all full conditional posterior distributions are known, and it is
possible to obtain an exact sample of parameters via Gibbs Sampler. The
incorporation of jumps in returns allows the model to capture speculative
movements of the data, so that their influence does not propagate to
volatility. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using synthetic and
real data time series.

1352,Anticipating Persistent Infection,"  We explore the emergence of persistent infection in a closed region where the
disease progression of the individuals is given by the SIRS model, with an
individual becoming infected on contact with another infected individual within
a given range. We focus on the role of synchronization in the persistence of
contagion. Our key result is that higher degree of synchronization, both
globally in the population and locally in the neighborhoods, hinders
persistence of infection. Importantly, we find that early short-time asynchrony
appears to be a consistent precursor to future persistence of infection, and
can potentially provide valuable early warnings for sustained contagion in a
population patch. Thus transient synchronization can help anticipate the
long-term persistence of infection. Further we demonstrate that when the range
of influence of an infected individual is wider, one obtains lower persistent
infection. This counter-intuitive observation can also be understood through
the relation of synchronization to infection burn-out.

1353,The exit time finite state projection scheme: bounding exit distributions and occupation measures of continuous-time Markov chains,"  We introduce the exit time finite state projection (ETFSP) scheme, a
truncation-based method that yields approximations to the exit distribution and
occupation measure associated with the time of exit from a domain (i.e., the
time of first passage to the complement of the domain) of time-homogeneous
continuous-time Markov chains. We prove that: (i) the computed approximations
bound the measures from below; (ii) the total variation distances between the
approximations and the measures decrease monotonically as states are added to
the truncation; and (iii) the scheme converges, in the sense that, as the
truncation tends to the entire state space, the total variation distances tend
to zero. Furthermore, we give a computable bound on the total variation
distance between the exit distribution and its approximation, and we delineate
the cases in which the bound is sharp. We also revisit the related finite state
projection scheme and give a comprehensive account of its theoretical
properties. We demonstrate the use of the ETFSP scheme by applying it to two
biological examples: the computation of the first passage time associated with
the expression of a gene, and the fixation times of competing species subject
to demographic noise.

1354,Who is the infector? Epidemic models with symptomatic and asymptomatic cases,"  What role do asymptomatically infected individuals play in the transmission
dynamics? There are many diseases, such as norovirus and influenza, where some
infected hosts show symptoms of the disease while others are asymptomatically
infected, i.e. do not show any symptoms. The current paper considers a class of
epidemic models following an SEIR (Susceptible $\to$ Exposed $\to$ Infectious
$\to$ Recovered) structure that allows for both symptomatic and asymptomatic
cases. The following question is addressed: what fraction $\rho$ of those
individuals getting infected are infected by symptomatic (asymptomatic) cases?
This is a more complicated question than the related question for the beginning
of the epidemic: what fraction of the expected number of secondary cases of a
typical newly infected individual, i.e. what fraction of the basic reproduction
number $R_0$, is caused by symptomatic individuals? The latter fraction only
depends on the type-specific reproduction numbers, while the former fraction
$\rho$ also depends on timing and hence on the probabilistic distributions of
latent and infectious periods of the two types (not only their means). Bounds
on $\rho$ are derived for the situation where these distributions (and even
their means) are unknown. Special attention is given to the class of Markov
models and the class of continuous-time Reed-Frost models as two classes of
distribution functions. We show how these two classes of models can exhibit
very different behaviour.

longer DNA reads compared to the next-generation sequencing technologies, are
becoming more and more popular. There are many possibilities to combine data
from next-generation and third-generation sequencing.
Herein, we present a new application called dnaasm-link for linking contigs,
a result of \textit{de novo} assembly of second-generation sequencing data,
with long DNA reads. Our tool includes an integrated module to fill gaps with a
suitable fragment of appropriate long DNA read, which improves the consistency
of the resulting DNA sequences. This feature is very important, in particular
for complex DNA regions, as presented in the paper. Finally, our implementation
outperforms other state-of-the-art tools in terms of speed and memory
requirements, which may enable the usage of the presented application for
organisms with a large genome, which is not possible in~existing applications.
The presented application has many advantages as (i) significant memory
optimization and reduction of computation time (ii) filling the gaps through
the appropriate fragment of a specified long DNA read (iii) reducing number of
spanned and unspanned gaps in the existing genome drafts.

multidimensional utility maximization problem from consumption with small

In the limit for small price impact, we determine the asymptotic expansion of
the value function around its frictionless version. The leading order
correction is characterized by a nonlinear second order PDE related to an

contribution plan during the decumulation phase. For a fixed annuitization
time, to achieve higher final annuity, we consider a variable consumption rate.
Moreover, to eliminate the ruin possibilities and having a minimum guarantee
for the final annuity, we consider a safety level for the wealth process which
consequently yields a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation on a bounded
domain. We apply the policy iteration method to find approximations of solution
of the HJB equation. Finally, we give the simulation results for the optimal
investment-consumption strategies, optimal wealth process and the final annuity
for different ranges of admissible consumptions. Furthermore, by calculating
the present market value of the future cash flows before and after the
annuitization, we compare the results for different consumption policies.

1359,Single-cell diffraction tomography with optofluidic rotation about a tilted axis,"  Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) is a tomographic technique that can be
used to measure the three-dimensional (3D) refractive index distribution within
living cells without the requirement of any marker. In principle, ODT can be
regarded as a generalization of optical projection tomography which is
equivalent to computerized tomography (CT). Both optical tomographic techniques
require projection-phase images of cells measured at multiple angles. However,
the reconstruction of the 3D refractive index distribution post-measurement
differs for the two techniques. It is known that ODT yields better results than
projection tomography, because it takes into account diffraction of the imaging
light due to the refractive index structure of the sample. Here, we apply ODT
to biological cells in a microfluidic chip which combines optical trapping and
microfluidic flow to achieve an optofluidic single-cell rotation. In
particular, we address the problem that arises when the trapped cell is not
rotating about an axis perpendicular to the imaging plane, but instead about an
arbitrarily tilted axis. In this paper we show that the 3D reconstruction can
be improved by taking into account such a tilted rotational axis in the
reconstruction process.

biology, medicine, and biotechnology. Synthetic design approaches profit
strongly from effective in-silico methods, which can tremendously impact their
cost and feasibility. We revisit a central ingredient of most in-silico design
methods: the sampling of sequences for the design of multi-target structures,
possibly including pseudoknots. For this task, we present the efficient, tree
decomposition-based algorithm. Our fixed parameter tractable approach is
underpinned by establishing the P-hardness of uniform sampling. Modeling the
problem as a constraint network, our program supports generic
Boltzmann-weighted sampling for arbitrary additive RNA energy models; this
enables the generation of RNA sequences meeting specific goals like expected
free energies or \GCb-content. Finally, we empirically study general properties
of the approach and generate biologically relevant multi-target
Boltzmann-weighted designs for a common design benchmark. Generating seed
sequences with our program, we demonstrate significant improvements over the
previously best multi-target sampling strategy (uniform sampling).Our software

1361,Using Stock Prices as Ground Truth in Sentiment Analysis to Generate Profitable Trading Signals,"  The increasing availability of ""big"" (large volume) social media data has
motivated a great deal of research in applying sentiment analysis to predict
the movement of prices within financial markets. Previous work in this field
investigates how the true sentiment of text (i.e. positive or negative
opinions) can be used for financial predictions, based on the assumption that
sentiments expressed online are representative of the true market sentiment.
Here we consider the converse idea, that using the stock price as the
ground-truth in the system may be a better indication of sentiment. Tweets are
labelled as Buy or Sell dependent on whether the stock price discussed rose or
fell over the following hour, and from this, stock-specific dictionaries are
built for individual companies. A Bayesian classifier is used to generate stock
predictions, which are input to an automated trading algorithm. Placing 468
trades over a 1 month period yields a return rate of 5.18%, which annualises to
approximately 83% per annum. This approach performs significantly better than
random chance and outperforms two baseline sentiment analysis methods tested.

1362,Deep Robust Framework for Protein Function Prediction using Variable-Length Protein Sequences,"  Amino acid sequence portrays most intrinsic form of a protein and expresses
primary structure of protein. The order of amino acids in a sequence enables a
protein to acquire a particular stable conformation that is responsible for the
functions of the protein. This relationship between a sequence and its function
motivates the need to analyse the sequences for predicting protein functions.
Early generation computational methods using BLAST, FASTA, etc. perform
function transfer based on sequence similarity with existing databases and are
computationally slow. Although machine learning based approaches are fast, they
fail to perform well for long protein sequences (i.e., protein sequences with
more than 300 amino acid residues). In this paper, we introduce a novel method
for construction of two separate feature sets for protein sequences based on
analysis of 1) single fixed-sized segments and 2) multi-sized segments, using
bi-directional long short-term memory network. Further, model based on proposed
feature set is combined with the state of the art Multi-lable Linear
Discriminant Analysis (MLDA) features based model to improve the accuracy.
Extensive evaluations using separate datasets for biological processes and
molecular functions demonstrate promising results for both single-sized and
multi-sized segments based feature sets. While former showed an improvement of
+3.37% and +5.48%, the latter produces an improvement of +5.38% and +8.00%
respectively for two datasets over the state of the art MLDA based classifier.
After combining two models, there is a significant improvement of +7.41% and
+9.21% respectively for two datasets compared to MLDA based classifier.
Specifically, the proposed approach performed well for the long protein
sequences and superior overall performance.

are becoming increasingly apparent, especially in clinical settings. However,
the unique characteristics of these data are not always well suited to machine
learning techniques. These data are often generated across different
technologies in different labs, and frequently with high dimensionality. In
this paper we present a framework for combining -omics data sets, and for
handling high dimensional data, making -omics research more accessible to
machine learning applications. We demonstrate the success of this framework
through integration and analysis of multi-analyte data for a set of 3,533
breast cancers. We then use this data-set to predict breast cancer patient
survival for individuals at risk of an impending event, with higher accuracy
and lower variance than methods trained on individual data-sets. We hope that
our pipelines for data-set generation and transformation will open up -omics
data to machine learning researchers. We have made these freely available for

1364,Dealing with the Dimensionality Curse in Dynamic Pricing Competition: Using Frequent Repricing to Compensate Imperfect Market Anticipations,"  Most sales applications are characterized by competition and limited demand
information. For successful pricing strategies, frequent price adjustments as
well as anticipation of market dynamics are crucial. Both effects are
challenging as competitive markets are complex and computations of optimized
pricing adjustments can be time-consuming. We analyze stochastic dynamic
pricing models under oligopoly competition for the sale of perishable goods. To
circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we propose a heuristic approach to
efficiently compute price adjustments. To demonstrate our strategy's
applicability even if the number of competitors is large and their strategies
are unknown, we consider different competitive settings in which competitors
frequently and strategically adjust their prices. For all settings, we verify
that our heuristic strategy yields promising results. We compare the
performance of our heuristic against upper bounds, which are obtained by
optimal strategies that take advantage of perfect price anticipations. We find
that price adjustment frequencies can have a larger impact on expected profits
than price anticipations. Finally, our approach has been applied on Amazon for
the sale of used books. We have used a seller's historical market data to
calibrate our model. Sales results show that our data-driven strategy
outperforms the rule-based strategy of an experienced seller by a profit
increase of more than 20%.

can be effectively modeled through a directed network, where the nodes
represent the companies, and the links indicate the ownership. This paper deals
with this theme and discusses the concentration of a market. A
cross-shareholding matrix is considered, along with two key factors: the node
out-degree distribution which represents the diversification of investments in
terms of the number of involved companies, and the node in-degree distribution
which reports the integration of a company due to the sales of its own shares
to other companies. While diversification is widely explored in the literature,
integration is most present in literature on contagions. This paper captures
such quantities of interest in the two frameworks and studies the stochastic
dependence of diversification and integration through a copula approach. We
adopt entropies as measures for assessing the concentration in the market. The
main question is to assess the dependence structure leading to a better
description of the data or to market polarization (minimal entropy) or market
fairness (maximal entropy). In so doing, we derive information on the way in
which the in- and out-degrees should be connected in order to shape the market.
The question is of interest to regulators bodies, as witnessed by specific
alert threshold published on the US mergers guidelines for limiting the
possibility of acquisitions and the prevalence of a single company on the
market. Indeed, all countries and the EU have also rules or guidelines in order
to limit concentrations, in a country or across borders, respectively. The
calibration of copulas and model parameters on the basis of real data serves as
an illustrative application of the theoretical proposal.

systems, including stochastic and coherence resonance, noise induced
bistability, noise-induced oscillations, to name but a few. In this paper we
revisit a mechanism first investigated in the context of neuroscience by which
relatively small demographic (intrinsic) fluctuations can lead to the emergence
of avalanching behavior in systems that are deterministically characterized by
a single stable fixed point (up state). The anomalously large response of such
systems to stochasticity stems (or is strongly associated with) the existence
of a ""non-normal"" stability matrix at the deterministic fixed point, which may
induce the system to be ""reactive"". Here, we further investigate this mechanism
by exploring the interplay between non-normality and intrinsic (demographic)
stochasticity, by employing a number of analytical and computational
approaches. We establish, in particular, that the resulting dynamics in this
type of systems cannot be simply derived from a scalar potential but,
additionally, one needs to consider a curl flux which describes the essential
non-equilibrium nature of this type of noisy non-normal systems. Moreover, we
shed further light on the origin of the phenomenon, introduce the novel concept
of ""non-linear reactivity"", and rationalize of the observed the value of the
emerging avalanche exponents.

1367,Superregular grammars do not provide additional explanatory power but allow for a compact analysis of animal song,"  A pervasive belief with regard to the differences between human language and
animal vocal sequences (song) is that they belong to different classes of
computational complexity, with animal song belonging to regular languages,
whereas human language is superregular. This argument, however, lacks empirical
evidence since superregular analyses of animal song are understudied. The goal
of this paper is to perform a superregular analysis of animal song, using data
from gibbons as a case study, and demonstrate that a superregular analysis can
be effectively used with non-human data. A key finding is that a superregular
analysis does not increase explanatory power but rather provides for compact
analysis. For instance, fewer grammatical rules are necessary once
superregularity is allowed. This pattern is analogous to a previous
computational analysis of human language, and accordingly, the null hypothesis,
that human language and animal song are governed by the same type of
grammatical systems, cannot be rejected.

the transcription factor activator in a genetic regulation system, with
non-Gaussian stable LÃƒÂ©vy noise in the synthesis reaction rate taking into
account. We calculate the most probable trajectory by spatially maximizing the
probability density of the system path, i.e., the solution of the associated
nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation. We especially examine those most probable
trajectories from low concentration state to high concentration state (i.e.,
the likely transcription regime) for certain parameters, in order to gain
insights into the transcription processes and the tipping time for the
transcription likely to occur. This enables us: (i) to visualize the progress
of concentration evolution (i.e., observe whether the system enters the
transcription regime within a given time period); (ii) to predict or avoid
certain transcriptions via selecting specific noise parameters in particular
regions in the parameter space. Moreover, we have found some peculiar or
counter-intuitive phenomena in this gene model system, including (a) a smaller
noise intensity may trigger the transcription process, while a larger noise
intensity can not, under the same asymmetric LÃƒÂ©vy noise. This phenomenon does
not occur in the case of symmetric LÃƒÂ©vy noise; (b) the symmetric LÃƒÂ©vy
motion always induces transition to high concentration, but certain asymmetric
LÃƒÂ©vy motions do not trigger the switch to transcription. These findings
provide insights for further experimental research, in order to achieve or to
avoid specific gene transcriptions, with possible relevance for medical
advances.

algorithms have not yet reached satisfactory performance to be used instead of
manual scoring by a sleep technician. Much research has been done to find good
feature representations that extract the useful information to correctly
classify each epoch into the correct sleep stage. While many useful features
have been discovered, the amount of features have grown to an extent that a
feature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of
dimensionality. One reason for the need of such a large feature set is that
many features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are
less informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature
representation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an
auto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the
training batch. This selective attention allows the model to learn feature
representations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to
perform any dimensionality reduction of the input data. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large data set of polysomnography (PSG)
night recordings of patients with sleep-disordered breathing. The performance
of the auto-encoder with selective attention is compared with a regular
auto-encoder and previous works using a deep belief network (DBN).

1372,A Hilbert Space of Stationary Ergodic Processes,"  Identifying meaningful signal buried in noise is a problem of interest
arising in diverse scenarios of data-driven modeling. We present here a
theoretical framework for exploiting intrinsic geometry in data that resists
noise corruption, and might be identifiable under severe obfuscation. Our
approach is based on uncovering a valid complete inner product on the space of
ergodic stationary finite valued processes, providing the latter with the
structure of a Hilbert space on the real field. This rigorous construction,
based on non-standard generalizations of the notions of sum and scalar
multiplication of finite dimensional probability vectors, allows us to
meaningfully talk about ""angles"" between data streams and data sources, and,
make precise the notion of orthogonal stochastic processes. In particular, the
relative angles appear to be preserved, and identifiable, under severe noise,
and will be developed in future as the underlying principle for robust
classification, clustering and unsupervised featurization algorithms.

1373,Conditional Optimal Stopping: A Time-Inconsistent Optimization,"  Inspired by recent work of P.-L. Lions on conditional optimal control, we
introduce a problem of optimal stopping under bounded rationality: the
objective is the expected payoff at the time of stopping, conditioned on
another event. For instance, an agent may care only about states where she is
still alive at the time of stopping, or a company may condition on not being
bankrupt. We observe that conditional optimization is time-inconsistent due to
the dynamic change of the conditioning probability and develop an equilibrium
approach in the spirit of R. H. Strotz' work for sophisticated agents in
discrete time. Equilibria are found to be essentially unique in the case of a
finite time horizon whereas an infinite horizon gives rise to non-uniqueness
and other interesting phenomena. We also introduce a theory which generalizes
the classical Snell envelope approach for optimal stopping by considering a
pair of processes with Snell-type properties.

between the occurrence of stationary and non-stationary populations within the

online discourse are expressed in Bitcoin exchange movements of price and
volume. Being inherently digital, all Bitcoin-related fundamental data (from
exchanges, as well as transactional data directly from the blockchain) is
available online, something that is not true for traditional businesses or
currencies traded on exchanges. This makes Bitcoin an interesting subject for
such research, as it enables the mapping of sentiment to fundamental events
that might otherwise be inaccessible. Furthermore, Bitcoin discussion largely
takes place on online forums and chat channels. In stock trading, the value of
sentiment data in trading decisions has been demonstrated numerous times [1]
[2] [3], and this research aims to determine whether there is value in such
data for Bitcoin trading models. To achieve this, data over the year 2015 has
been collected from Bitcointalk.org, (the biggest Bitcoin forum in post
volume), established news sources such as Bloomberg and the Wall Street
Journal, the complete /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin subreddits, and the bitcoin-otc and
bitcoin-dev IRC channels. By analyzing this data on sentiment and volume, we
find weak to moderate correlations between forum, news, and Reddit sentiment
and movements in price and volume from 1 to 5 days after the sentiment was
expressed. A Granger causality test confirms the predictive causality of the
sentiment on the daily percentage price and volume movements, and at the same
time underscores the predictive causality of market movements on sentiment

1377,Credit Risk Meets Random Matrices: Coping with Non-Stationary Asset Correlations,"  We review recent progress in modeling credit risk for correlated assets. We
start from the Merton model which default events and losses are derived from
the asset values at maturity. To estimate the time development of the asset
values, the stock prices are used whose correlations have a strong impact on
the loss distribution, particularly on its tails. These correlations are
non-stationary which also influences the tails. We account for the asset
fluctuations by averaging over an ensemble of random matrices that models the
truly existing set of measured correlation matrices. As a most welcome side
effect, this approach drastically reduces the parameter dependence of the loss
distribution, allowing us to obtain very explicit results which show
quantitatively that the heavy tails prevail over diversification benefits even
for small correlations. We calibrate our random matrix model with market data
and show how it is capable of grasping different market situations.

1378,Environmental feedback drives cooperation in spatial social dilemmas,"  Exploiting others is beneficial individually but it could also be detrimental
globally. The reverse is also true: a higher cooperation level may change the
environment in a way that is beneficial for all competitors. To explore the
possible consequence of this feedback we consider a coevolutionary model where
the local cooperation level determines the payoff values of the applied
prisoner's dilemma game. We observe that the coevolutionary rule provides a
significantly higher cooperation level comparing to the traditional setup
independently of the topology of the applied interaction graph. Interestingly,
this cooperation supporting mechanism offers lonely defectors a high surviving
chance for a long period hence the relaxation to the final cooperating state
happens logarithmically slow. As a consequence, the extension of the
traditional evolutionary game by considering interactions with the environment
provides a good opportunity for cooperators, but their reward may arrive with
some delay.

1379,Sex-biased dispersal: a review of the theory,"  Dispersal is ubiquitous throughout the tree of life: factors selecting for
dispersal include kin competition, inbreeding avoidance and spatiotemporal
variation in resources or habitat suitability. These factors differ in whether
they promote male and female dispersal equally strongly, and often selection on
dispersal of one sex depends on how much the other disperses. For example, for
inbreeding avoidance it can be sufficient that one sex disperses away from the
natal site. Attempts to understand sex-specific dispersal evolution have
created a rich body of theoretical literature, which we review here. We
highlight an interesting gap between empirical and theoretical literature. The
former associates different patterns of sex-biased dispersal with mating
systems, such as female-biased dispersal in monogamous birds and male-biased
dispersal in polygynous mammals. The predominant explanation is traceable back
to Greenwood's (1980) ideas of how successful philopatric or dispersing
individuals are at gaining mates or resources required to attract them. Theory,
however, has developed surprisingly independently of these ideas: predominant
ideas in theoretical work track how immigration and emigration change
relatedness patterns and alleviate competition for limiting resources,
typically considered sexually distinct, with breeding sites and fertilisable
females limiting reproductive success for females and males, respectively. We
show that the link between mating system and sex-biased dispersal is far from
resolved: there are studies showing that mating systems matter, but the
oft-stated association between polygyny and male-biased dispersal is not a
straightforward theoretical expectation... (full abstract in the PDF)

1380,A geometrical analysis of global stability in trained feedback networks,"  Recurrent neural networks have been extensively studied in the context of
neuroscience and machine learning due to their ability to implement complex
computations. While substantial progress in designing effective learning
algorithms has been achieved in the last years, a full understanding of trained
recurrent networks is still lacking. Specifically, the mechanisms that allow
computations to emerge from the underlying recurrent dynamics are largely
unknown. Here we focus on a simple, yet underexplored computational setup: a
feedback architecture trained to associate a stationary output to a stationary
input. As a starting point, we derive an approximate analytical description of
global dynamics in trained networks which assumes uncorrelated connectivity
weights in the feedback and in the random bulk. The resulting mean-field theory
suggests that the task admits several classes of solutions, which imply
different stability properties. Different classes are characterized in terms of
the geometrical arrangement of the readout with respect to the input vectors,
defined in the high-dimensional space spanned by the network population. We
find that such approximate theoretical approach can be used to understand how
standard training techniques implement the input-output task in finite-size
feedback networks. In particular, our simplified description captures the local
and the global stability properties of the target solution, and thus predicts
training performance.

1381,The agreement distance of rooted phylogenetic networks,"  The minimal number of rooted subtree prune and regraft (rSPR) operations
needed to transform one phylogenetic tree into another one induces a metric on
phylogenetic trees - the rSPR-distance. The rSPR-distance between two
phylogenetic trees $T$ and $T'$ can be characterised by a maximum agreement
forest; a forest with a minimal number of components that covers both $T$ and
$T'$. The rSPR operation has recently been generalised to phylogenetic networks
with, among others, the subnetwork prune and regraft (SNPR) operation. Here, we
introduce maximum agreement graphs as an explicit representations of
differences of two phylogenetic networks, thus generalising maximum agreement
forests. We show that maximum agreement graphs induce a metric on phylogenetic
networks - the agreement distance. While this metric does not characterise the
distances induced by SNPR and other generalisations of rSPR, we prove that it
still bounds these distances with constant factors.

1382,Introducing AIC model averaging in ecological niche modeling: a single-algorithm multi-model strategy to account for uncertainty in suitability predictions,"  Aim: The Akaike information Criterion (AIC) is widely used science to make
predictions about complex phenomena based on an entire set of models weighted
by Akaike weights. This approach (AIC model averaging; hereafter AvgAICc) is
often preferable than alternatives based on the selection of a single model.
Surprisingly, AvgAICc has not yet been introduced in ecological niche modeling
(ENM). We aimed to introduce AvgAICc in the context of ENM to serve both as an
optimality criterion in analyses that tune-up model parameters and as a
multi-model prediction strategy.
Innovation: Results from the AvgAICc approach differed from those of
alternative approaches with respect to model complexity, contribution of
environmental variables, and predicted amount and geographic location of
suitable conditions for the focal species. Two theoretical properties of the
AvgAICc approach might justify that future studies will prefer its use over
alternative approaches: (1) it is not limited to make predictions based on a
single model, but it also uses secondary models that might have important
predictive power absent in a given single model favored by alternative
optimality criteria; (2) it balances goodness of fit and model accuracy, this
being of critical importance in applications of ENM that require model
transference.
Main conclusions: Our introduction of the AvgAICc approach in ENM; its
theoretical properties, which are expected to confer advantages over
alternatives approaches; and the differences we found when comparing the
AvgAICc approach with alternative ones; should eventually lead to a wider use
of the AvgAICc approach. Our work should also promote further methodological
research comparing properties of the AvgAICc approach with respect to those of
alternative procedures.

dementia risk from neuroimaging, but their accuracy to date is unclear.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for
machine learning studies differentiating healthy ageing through to dementia of
various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different
disease boundaries.
RESULTS: Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs
healthy controls, used ADNI data, support vector machines and only T1-weighted
sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating AD from healthy controls,
and poor for differentiating healthy controls vs MCI vs AD, or MCI converters
vs non-converters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by
data source, sample size or machine learning method.
DISCUSSION: Machine learning does not differentiate clinically-relevant
disease categories yet. More diverse datasets, combinations of different types
of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to
advance the field.

important applications in the biomedical field. The possibility to engineer
graphene-based medical devices at the neuronal interface is of particular
interest, making it imperative to determine the biocompatibility of graphene
materials with neuronal cells. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of
the effects of chronic and acute exposure of rat primary cortical neurons to
few-layers pristine graphene (GR) and monolayer graphene oxide (GO) flakes. By
combining a range of cell biology, microscopy, electrophysiology and omics
approaches we characterized the graphene neuron interaction from the first
steps of membrane contact and internalization to the long-term effects on cell
viability, synaptic transmission and cell metabolism. GR/GO flakes are found in
contact with the neuronal membrane, free in the cytoplasm and internalized
through the endolysosomal pathway, with no significant impact on neuron
viability. However, GO exposure selectively caused the inhibition of excitatory
transmission, paralleled by a reduction in the number of excitatory synaptic
contacts, and a concomitant enhancement of the inhibitory activity. This was
accompanied by induction of autophagy, altered Ca2+ dynamics and by a
downregulation of some of the main players in the regulation of Ca2+
homeostasis in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Our results show that,
although graphene exposure does not impact on neuron viability, it does
nevertheless have important effects on neuronal transmission and network
functionality, thus warranting caution when planning to employ this material
for neuro-biological applications.

1389,Distinct dynamical behavior in random and all-to-all neuronal networks,"  Neuronal network dynamics depends on network structure. It is often assumed
that neurons are connected at random when their actual connectivity structure
is unknown. Such models are then often approximated by replacing the random
network by an all-to-all network, where every neuron is connected to all other
neurons. This mean-field approximation is a common approach in statistical
physics. In this paper we show that such approximation can be invalid. We solve
analytically a neuronal network model with binary-state neurons in both random
and all-to-all networks. We find strikingly different phase diagrams
corresponding to each network structure. Neuronal network dynamics is not only
different within certain parameter ranges, but it also undergoes different
bifurcations. Our results therefore suggest cautiousness when using mean-field
models based on all-to-all network topologies to represent random networks.

fixation probability of a favorable mutation in large asexual populations.
While the hindering effect of strongly deleterious mutations on adaptive
evolution has been well studied, how weak deleterious mutations, either in
isolation or with superior beneficial mutations, influence the fixation of a
beneficial mutation has not been fully explored. Here, using a multitype
branching process, we obtain an accurate analytical expression for the fixation
probability when deleterious effects are weak, and exploit this result along
with the clonal interference theory to investigate the joint effect of linked
beneficial and deleterious mutations on the rate of adaptation. We find that
when the mutation rate is increased beyond the beneficial fitness effect, the
fixation probability of the beneficial mutant decreases from Haldane's
classical result towards zero. This has the consequence that above a critical
mutation rate that may depend on the population size, the adaptation rate
decreases exponentially with the mutation rate and is independent of the
population size. In addition, we find that for a range of mutation rates, both
beneficial and deleterious mutations interfere and impede the adaptation
process in large populations. We also study the evolution of mutation rates in
adapting asexual populations, and conclude that linked beneficial mutations
have a stronger influence on mutator fixation than the deleterious mutations.

to counter the otherwise lethal intracellular formation of ice. Structures and
sequences of various AFPs exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, consequently
the prediction of the AFPs is considered to be a challenging task. In this

notion of localized processing. In particular an AFP sequence is segmented into
two sub-segments each of which is analyzed for amino acid and di-peptide
compositions. We propose to use only the most significant features using the
concept of information gain (IG) followed by a random forest classification

1392,Mechanisms for bacterial gliding motility on soft substrates,"  The motility mechanism of certain rod-shaped bacteria has long been a
mystery, since no external appendages are involved in their motion which is
known as gliding. However, the physical principles behind gliding motility
still remain poorly understood. Using myxobacteria as a canonical example of
such organisms, we identify here the physical principles behind gliding
motility, and develop a theoretical model that predicts a two-regime behavior
of the gliding speed as a function of the substrate stiffness. Our theory
describes the elastic, viscous, and capillary interactions between the
bacterial membrane carrying a traveling wave, the secreted slime acting as a
lubricating film, and the substrate which we model as a soft solid. Defining
the myxobacterial gliding as the horizontal motion on the substrate under zero
net force, we find the two-regime behavior is due to two different mechanisms
of motility thrust. On stiff substrates, the thrust arises from the bacterial
shape deformations creating a flow of slime that exerts a pressure along the
bacterial length. This pressure in conjunction with the bacterial shape
provides the necessary thrust for propulsion. However, we show that such a
mechanism cannot lead to gliding on very soft substrates. Instead, we show that
capillary effects lead to the formation of a ridge at the slime-substrate-air
interface, which creates a thrust in the form of a localized pressure gradient
at the tip of the bacteria. To test our theory, we perform experiments with
isolated cells on agar substrates of varying stiffness and find the measured
gliding speeds to be in good agreement with the predictions from our
elasto-capillary-hydrodynamic model. The physical mechanisms reported here
serve as an important step towards an accurate theory of friction and
substrate-mediated interaction between bacteria in a swarm of cells
proliferating in soft media.

1394,Dynein catch bond as a mediator of codependent bidirectional cellular transport,"  Intracellular bidirectional transport of cargo on Microtubule filaments is
achieved by the collective action of oppositely directed dynein and kinesin
motors. Experimental investigations probing the nature of bidirectional
transport have found that in certain cases, inhibiting the activity of one type
of motor results in an overall decline in the motility of the cellular cargo in
both directions. This somewhat counter-intuitive observation, referred to as
paradox of codependence is inconsistent with the existing paradigm of a
mechanistic tug-of-war between oppositely directed motors. Existing theoretical
models do not take into account a key difference in the functionality of
kinesin and dynein. Unlike kinesin, dynein motors exhibit catchbonding, wherein
the unbinding rates of these motors from the filaments are seen to decrease
with increasing force on them. Incorporating this catchbonding behavior of
dynein in a theoretical model and using experimentally relevant measures
characterizing cargo transport, we show that the functional divergence of the
two motors species manifests itself as an internal regulatory mechanism for
bidirectional transport and resolves the paradox of codependence. Our model
reproduces the key experimental features in appropriate parameter regimes and
provides an unifying framework for bidirectional cargo transport.

the famous Q-Learning method for RL with the Black-Scholes (-Merton) model's

of Fitted Q Iteration for a RL (data-driven) solution to the model, and

the model, where we only observe prices and actions (re-hedges) taken by a
trader, but not rewards. Third, we outline how the QLBS model can be used for
pricing portfolios of options, rather than a single option in isolation, thus
providing its own, data-driven and model independent solution to the (in)famous

electroencephalogram (EEG) and enhanced synchrony at 3-7 and 7-30 Hz in the
basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex. This study describes the dynamics of a
physiologically based mean-field model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical
system, and shows how it accounts for key electrophysiological correlates of
PD. Its connectivity comprises partially segregated direct and indirect
pathways through the striatum, a hyperdirect pathway involving a
corticosubthalamic projection, thalamostriatal feedback, and local inhibition
in striatum and external pallidum (GPe). In a companion paper, realistic
steady-state firing rates were obtained for the healthy state, and after
dopamine loss modeled by weaker direct and stronger indirect pathways, reduced
intrapallidal inhibition, lower firing thresholds of the GPe and subthalamic
nucleus (STN), a stronger striato-GPe projection, and weaker cortical
interactions. Here we show that oscillations around 5 and 20 Hz can arise with
a strong indirect pathway, which also increases synchrony throughout the basal
ganglia. Further, increased theta power with nigrostriatal degeneration
correlates with reduced alpha power and peak frequency, matching experiments.
Unlike the hyperdirect pathway, the indirect pathway sustains oscillations with
realistic phase relationships. Changes in basal ganglia responses to transient
stimuli accord with experimental data. Reduced cortical gains due to both
nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine loss lead to slower cortical activity
changes and may be related to bradykinesia. Finally, increased EEG power found
in some studies may be partly explained by a lower effective GPe firing
threshold, reduced GPe-GPe inhibition, and/or weaker intracortical connections
in PD. Strict separation of the direct and indirect pathways is not necessary
for these results.

considerable variability in the values of key parameters of multiple
interacting processes that govern that function? Here we use the classic
Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the squid giant axon action potential to propose
a possible approach to this problem. Although the full Hodgkin-Huxley model is
very sensitive to fluctuations that independently occur in its many parameters,
the outcome is in fact determined by simple combinations of these parameters
along two physiological dimensions: Structural and Kinetic (denoted $S$ and
$K$). Structural parameters describe the properties of the cell, including its
capacitance and the densities of its ion channels. Kinetic parameters are those
that describe the opening and closing of the voltage-dependent conductances.
The impacts of parametric fluctuations on the dynamics of the system, seemingly
complex in the high dimensional representation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, are
tractable when examined within the $S-K$ plane. We demonstrate that slow
inactivation, a ubiquitous activity-dependent feature of ionic channels, is a
powerful local homeostatic control mechanism that stabilizes excitability amid
changes in structural and kinetic parameters.

1399,Analysis of Extremely Obese Individuals Using Deep Learning Stacked Autoencoders and Genome-Wide Genetic Data,"  The aetiology of polygenic obesity is multifactorial, which indicates that
life-style and environmental factors may influence multiples genes to aggravate
this disorder. Several low-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
been associated with BMI. However, identified loci only explain a small
proportion of the variation ob-served for this phenotype. The linear nature of
genome wide association studies (GWAS) used to identify associations between
genetic variants and the phenotype have had limited success in explaining the
heritability variation of BMI and shown low predictive capacity in
classification studies. GWAS ignores the epistatic interactions that less
significant variants have on the phenotypic outcome. In this paper we utilise a
novel deep learning-based methodology to reduce the high dimensional space in
GWAS and find epistatic interactions between SNPs for classification purposes.
SNPs were filtered based on the effects associations have with BMI. Since
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing is highly conservative, an important
proportion of SNPs involved in SNP-SNP interactions are ignored. Therefore,
only SNPs with p-values < 1x10-2 were considered for subsequent epistasis
analysis using stacked auto encoders (SAE). This allows the nonlinearity
present in SNP-SNP interactions to be discovered through progressively smaller
hidden layer units and to initialise a multi-layer feedforward artificial
neural network (ANN) classifier. The classifier is fine-tuned to classify
extremely obese and non-obese individuals. The best results were obtained with

the targeted stocks. These impacts affect predators and prey of the harvested
species, as well as the whole ecosystem it inhabits. Ecosystem models can be
used to study the interactions that occur within a system, including those
between different organisms and those between fisheries and targeted species.
Trophic web models like Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) can handle fishing fleets as
a top predator, with top-down impact on harvested organisms. The aim of this
study was to better understand the Icelandic marine ecosystem and the
interactions within. This was done by constructing an EwE model of Icelandic
waters. The model was run from 1984 to 2013 and was fitted to time series of
biomass estimates, landings data and mean annual temperature. The final model
was chosen by selecting the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion.
A skill assessment was performed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient,
the coefficient of determination, the modelling efficiency and the reliability
index to evaluate the model performance. The model performed satisfactorily
when simulating previously estimated biomass and known landings. Most of the
groups with time series were estimated to have top-down control over their
prey. These are harvested species with direct and/or indirect links to lower
trophic levels and future fishing policies should take this into account. This
model could be used as a tool to investigate how such policies could impact the
marine ecosystem in Icelandic waters.

1402,Increased adaptability to rapid environmental change can more than make up for the two-fold cost of males,"  The famous ""two-fold cost of sex"" is really the cost of anisogamy -- why
should females mate with males who do not contribute resources to offspring,
rather than isogamous partners who contribute equally? In typical anisogamous
populations, a single very fit male can have an enormous number of offspring,
far larger than is possible for any female or isogamous individual. If the
sexual selection on males aligns with the natural selection on females,
anisogamy thus allows much more rapid adaptation via super-successful males. We
show via simulations that this effect can be sufficient to overcome the
two-fold cost and maintain anisogamy against isogamy in populations adapting to
environmental change. The key quantity is the variance in male fitness -- if
this exceeds what is possible in an isogamous population, anisogamous
populations can win out in direct competition by adapting faster.

analysis of complex chemical reaction networks derived from semi-accurate but
efficient electronic structure calculations. It is designed to (i) accelerate
the automated exploration of such networks, and (ii) cope with model-inherent
errors in electronic structure calculations on elementary reaction steps. We
developed and implemented KiNetX to possess three features. First, KiNetX
evaluates the kinetic relevance of every species in a (yet incomplete) reaction
network to confine the search for new elementary reaction steps only to those
species that are considered possibly relevant. Second, KiNetX identifies and
eliminates all kinetically irrelevant species and elementary reactions to
reduce a complex network graph to a comprehensible mechanism. Third, KiNetX
estimates the sensitivity of species concentrations toward changes in
individual rate constants (derived from relative free energies), which allows
us to systematically select the most efficient electronic structure model for
each elementary reaction given a predefined accuracy. The novelty of KiNetX
consists in the rigorous propagation of correlated free-energy uncertainty
through all steps of our kinetic analyis. To examine the performance of KiNetX,
we developed AutoNetGen. It semirandomly generates chemistry-mimicking reaction
networks by encoding chemical logic into their underlying graph structure.
AutoNetGen allows us to consider a vast number of distinct chemistry-like
scenarios and, hence, to discuss assess the importance of rigorous uncertainty
propagation in a statistical context. Our results reveal that KiNetX reliably
supports the deduction of product ratios, dominant reaction pathways, and
possibly other network properties from semi-accurate electronic structure data.

(LH) statistical scheme is widely-used to partition the effect of biodiversity
on ecosystem properties into a ""complementarity effect"" and a ""selection

selection term in the Price equation from evolutionary biology. However, a key
paper published over thirteen years ago challenged this interpretation by
devising a new tripartite partitioning scheme that purportedly quantified the
role of selection in biodiversity experiments more accurately. This tripartite
method, as well as its recent spatiotemporal extension, were both developed as
an attempt to apply the Price equation in a BEF context. Here, we demonstrate
that the derivation of this tripartite method, as well as its spatiotemporal
extension, involve a set of incoherent and nonsensical mathematical arguments
driven largely by naÃƒÂ¯ve visual analogies with the original Price equation,
that result in neither partitioning scheme quantifying any real property in the
natural world. Furthermore, we show that Loreau and Hector's original selection
effect always represented a true analog of the original Price selection term,
making the tripartite partitioning scheme a nonsensical solution to a

1405,Infinitesimal perturbation analysis for risk measures based on the Smith max-stable random field,"  When using risk or dependence measures based on a given underlying model, it
is essential to be able to quantify the sensitivity or robustness of these
measures with respect to the model parameters. In this paper, we consider an
underlying model which is very popular in spatial extremes, the Smith
max-stable random field. We study the sensitivity properties of risk or
dependence measures based on the values of this field at a finite number of
locations. Max-stable fields play a key role, e.g., in the modelling of natural
disasters. As their multivariate density is generally not available for more
than three locations, the Likelihood Ratio Method cannot be used to estimate
the derivatives of the risk measures with respect to the model parameters.
Thus, we focus on a pathwise method, the Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis
(IPA). We provide a convenient and tractable sufficient condition for
performing IPA, which is intricate to obtain because of the very structure of
max-stable fields involving pointwise maxima over an infinite number of random
functions. IPA enables the consistent estimation of the considered measures'
derivatives with respect to the parameters characterizing the spatial
dependence. We carry out a simulation study which shows that the approach
performs well in various configurations.

1406,The sum of log-normal variates in geometric Brownian motion,"  Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is a key model for representing
self-reproducing entities. Self-reproduction may be considered the definition
of life [5], and the dynamics it induces are of interest to those concerned
with living systems from biology to economics. Trajectories of GBM are
distributed according to the well-known log-normal density, broadening with
time. However, in many applications, what's of interest is not a single
trajectory but the sum, or average, of several trajectories. The distribution
of these objects is more complicated. Here we show two different ways of
finding their typical trajectories. We make use of an intriguing connection to
spin glasses: the expected free energy of the random energy model is an average
of log-normal variates. We make the mapping to GBM explicit and find that the
free energy result gives qualitatively correct behavior for GBM trajectories.
We then also compute the typical sum of lognormal variates using Ito calculus.
This alternative route is in close quantitative agreement with numerical work.

density than cytoplasm"", we provided strong evidence indicating that the
nuclear refractive index (RI) is lower than the RI of the cytoplasm for several
cell lines. In a complementary study in 2017, entitled ""Is the nuclear
refractive index lower than cytoplasm? Validation of phase measurements and
implications for light scattering technologies"", Steelman et al. observed a
lower nuclear RI also for other cell lines and ruled out methodological error
sources such as phase wrapping and scattering effects. Recently, Yurkin
composed a comment on these 2 publications, entitled ""How a phase image of a
cell with nucleus refractive index smaller than that of the cytoplasm should
look like?"", putting into question the methods used for measuring the cellular
and nuclear RI in the aforementioned publications by suggesting that a lower
nuclear RI would produce a characteristic dip in the measured phase profile in
situ. We point out the difficulty of identifying this dip in the presence of
other cell organelles, noise, or blurring due to the imaging point spread
function. Furthermore, we mitigate Yurkin's concerns regarding the ability of
the simple-transmission approximation to compare cellular and nuclear RI by
analyzing a set of phase images with a novel, scattering-based approach. We
conclude that the absence of a characteristic dip in the measured phase
profiles does not contradict the usage of the simple-transmission approximation
for the determination of the average cellular or nuclear RI. Our response can
be regarded as an addition to the response by Steelman, Eldridge and Wax. We
kindly ask the reader to attend to their thorough ascertainment prior to
reading our response.

1408,Autoregressive Point-Processes as Latent State-Space Models: a Moment-Closure Approach to Fluctuations and Autocorrelations,"  Modeling and interpreting spike train data is a task of central importance in
computational neuroscience, with significant translational implications. Two
popular classes of data-driven models for this task are autoregressive Point
Process Generalized Linear models (PPGLM) and latent State-Space models (SSM)
with point-process observations. In this letter, we derive a mathematical
connection between these two classes of models. By introducing an auxiliary
history process, we represent exactly a PPGLM in terms of a latent, infinite
dimensional dynamical system, which can then be mapped onto an SSM by basis
function projections and moment closure. This representation provides a new
perspective on widely used methods for modeling spike data, and also suggests
novel algorithmic approaches to fitting such models. We illustrate our results
on a phasic bursting neuron model, showing that our proposed approach provides
an accurate and efficient way to capture neural dynamics.

1409,A time change strategy to model reporting delay dynamics in claims reserving,"  This paper considers the problem of predicting the number of claims that have
already incurred in past exposure years, but which have not yet been reported
to the insurer. This is an important building block in the risk management
strategy of an insurer since the company should be able to fulfill its
liabilities with respect to such claims. Our approach puts emphasis on modeling
the time between the occurrence and reporting of claims, the so-called
reporting delay. Using data at a daily level we propose a micro-level model for
the heterogeneity in reporting delay caused by calendar day effects in the
reporting process, such as the weekday pattern and holidays. A simulation study
identifies the strengths and weaknesses of our approach in several scenarios
compared to traditional methods to predict the number of incurred but not
reported claims from aggregated data (i.e. the chain ladder method). We also
illustrate our model on a European general liability insurance data set and
conclude that the granular approach compared to the chain ladder method is more
robust with respect to volatility in the occurrence process. Our framework can
be extended to other predictive problems where interest goes to events that
incurred in the past but which are subject to an observation delay (e.g. the
number of infections during an epidemic).

1410,Geometric comparison of phylogenetic trees with different leaf sets,"  The metric space of phylogenetic trees defined by Billera, Holmes, and
Vogtmann, which we refer to as BHV space, provides a natural geometric setting
for describing collections of trees on the same set of taxa. However, it is
sometimes necessary to analyze collections of trees on non-identical taxa sets
(i.e., with different numbers of leaves), and in this context it is not evident
how to apply BHV space. Davidson et al. recently approached this problem by
describing a combinatorial algorithm extending tree topologies to regions in
higher dimensional tree spaces, so that one can quickly compute which
topologies contain a given tree as partial data. In this paper, we refine and
adapt their algorithm to work for metric trees to give a full characterization
of the subspace of extensions of a subtree. We describe how to apply our
algorithm to define and search a space of possible supertrees and, for a
collection of tree fragments with different leaf sets, to measure their
compatibility.

1411,Asset Price Bubbles: An Option-based Indicator,"  We construct a statistical indicator for the detection of short-term asset
price bubbles based on the information content of bid and ask market quotes for
plain vanilla put and call options. Our construction makes use of the
martingale theory of asset price bubbles and the fact that such scenarios where
the price for an asset exceeds its fundamental value can in principle be
detected by analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the implied volatility
surface. For extrapolating this implied volatility, we choose the SABR model,
mainly because of its decent fit to real option market quotes for a broad range
of maturities and its ease of calibration. As main theoretical result, we show
that under lognormal SABR dynamics, we can compute a simple yet powerful
closed-form martingale defect indicator by solving an ill-posed inverse
calibration problem. In order to cope with the ill-posedness and to quantify
the uncertainty which is inherent to such an indicator, we adopt a Bayesian
statistical parameter estimation perspective. We probe the resulting posterior
densities with a combination of optimization and adaptive Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods, thus providing a full-blown uncertainty estimation of all the
underlying parameters and the martingale defect indicator. Finally, we provide
real-market tests of the proposed option-based indicator with focus on tech
stocks due to increasing concerns about a tech bubble 2.0.

attention around the world. The factors influencing the prices of real estate
are diversified and complex. However, due to the limitations and one-sidedness
of their respective views, they did not provide enough theoretical basis for
the fluctuation of house price and its influential factors. The purpose of this

proposes some countermeasures to reasonably control house prices. Specifically,
the paper analyzes eight factors which affect the house prices from two
aspects: housing supply and demand and find out the factor which is of vital
importance to the increase of housing price per square meter. The problem of a
high level of multicollinearity between them is solved by using principal

1413,Single-molecule imaging of DNA gyrase activity in living Escherichia coli,"  Bacterial DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoils into chromosomal DNA and
relaxes positive supercoils introduced by replication and transiently by
transcription. Removal of these positive supercoils is essential for
replication fork progression and for the overall unlinking of the two duplex
DNA strands, as well as for ongoing transcription. To address how gyrase copes
with these topological challenges, we used high-speed single-molecule
fluorescence imaging in live Escherichia coli cells. We demonstrate that at
least 300 gyrase molecules are stably bound to the chromosome at any time, with
~12 enzymes enriched near each replication fork. Trapping of reaction
intermediates with ciprofloxacin revealed complexes undergoing catalysis. Dwell
times of ~2 s were observed for the dispersed gyrase molecules, which we
propose maintain steady-state levels of negative supercoiling of the
chromosome. In contrast, the dwell time of replisome-proximal molecules was ~8
s, consistent with these catalyzing processive positive supercoil relaxation in
front of the progressing replisome.

result that is exploited to quickly price arbitrary continuous payoffs. This
approach to pricing derivatives is then tested with European options, American
options, Asian options, lookback options and variance swaps. As we show,
signature payoffs can be used to price these derivatives with very high

1415,Reliable counting of weakly labeled concepts by a single spiking neuron model,"  Making an informed, correct and quick decision can be life-saving. It's
crucial for animals during an escape behaviour or for autonomous cars during
driving. The decision can be complex and may involve an assessment of the
amount of threats present and the nature of each threat. Thus, we should expect
early sensory processing to supply classification information fast and
accurately, even before relying the information to higher brain areas or more
complex system components downstream. Today, advanced convolutional artificial
neural networks can successfully solve visual detection and classification
tasks and are commonly used to build complex decision making systems. However,
in order to perform well on these tasks they require increasingly complex,
""very deep"" model structure, which is costly in inference run-time, energy
consumption and number of training samples, only trainable on cloud-computing
clusters. A single spiking neuron has been shown to be able to solve
recognition tasks for homogeneous Poisson input statistics, a commonly used
model for spiking activity in the neocortex. When modeled as leaky integrate
and fire with gradient decent learning algorithm it was shown to posses a
variety of complex computational capabilities. Here we improve its
implementation. We also account for more natural stimulus generated inputs that
deviate from this homogeneous Poisson spiking. The improved gradient-based
local learning rule allows for significantly better and stable generalization.
We also show that with its improved capabilities it can count weakly labeled
concepts by applying our model to a problem of multiple instance learning (MIL)
with counting where labels are only available for collections of concepts. In
this counting MNIST task the neuron exploits the improved implementation and
outperforms conventional ConvNet architecture under similar condtions.

metals to a variety of minor metals, such as cobalt or indium. The industrial
importance and limited geological availability of some minor metals have led to
them being considered more ""critical,"" and there is a growing investment
interest in such critical metals and their producing companies. In this
research, we create a novel framework, Dynamic Advisor-Based Ensemble (dynABE),
for stock prediction and use critical metal companies as case study. dynABE
uses domain knowledge to diversify the feature set by dividing them into
different ""advisors."" creates high-level ensembles with complex base models for
each advisor, and combines the advisors together dynamically during validation
with a novel and effective online update strategy. We test dynABE on three
cobalt-related companies, and it achieves the best-case misclassification error
of 31.12% and excess return of 477% compared to the stock itself in a year and
a half. In addition to presenting an effective stock prediction model with
decent profitabilities, this research further analyzes dynABE to visualize how
it works in practice, which also yields discoveries of its interesting
behaviors when processing time-series data.

1417,The clock of chemical evolution,"  Chemical evolution is essential in understanding the origins of life. We
present a theory for the evolution of molecule masses and show that small
molecules grow by random diffusion and large molecules by a preferential
attachment process leading eventually to life's molecules. It reproduces
correctly the distribution of molecules found via mass spectroscopy for the
Murchison meteorite and estimates the start of chemical evolution back to 12.8
billion years following the birth of stars and supernovae. From the Frontier
mass between the random and preferential attachment dynamics the birth time of
molecule families can be estimated. Amino acids emerge about 165 million years
after the start of evolution. Using the scaling of reaction rates with the
distance of the molecules in space we recover correctly the few days emergence
time of amino acids in the Miller-Urey experiment. The distribution of
interstellar and extragalactic molecules are both consistent with the
evolutionary mass distribution, and their age is estimated to 108 and 65
million years after the start of evolution. From the model, we can determine
the number of different molecule compositions at the time of the creation of
Earth to be 1.6 million and the number of molecule compositions in interstellar
space to a mere 719.

size and interconnectivity, a counterintuitive result of widespread importance
across the physical, life, and social sciences. Despite recent interest in the
relationship between system properties and stability, the effect of variation
in the response rate of individual system components remains unconsidered. Here
I vary the component response rates ($\boldsymbol{\gamma}$) of randomly
generated complex systems. I show that when component response rates vary, the
potential for system stability is markedly increased. Variation in
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ becomes increasingly important as system size increases,
such that the largest stable complex systems would be unstable if not for
$\boldsymbol{Var(\gamma)}$. My results reveal a previously unconsidered driver
of system stability that is likely to be pervasive across all complex systems.

1420,Discovering Bayesian Market Views for Intelligent Asset Allocation,"  Along with the advance of opinion mining techniques, public mood has been
found to be a key element for stock market prediction. However, how market
participants' behavior is affected by public mood has been rarely discussed.
Consequently, there has been little progress in leveraging public mood for the
asset allocation problem, which is preferred in a trusted and interpretable
way. In order to address the issue of incorporating public mood analyzed from
social media, we propose to formalize public mood into market views, because
market views can be integrated into the modern portfolio theory. In our
framework, the optimal market views will maximize returns in each period with a
Bayesian asset allocation model. We train two neural models to generate the
market views, and benchmark the model performance on other popular asset
allocation strategies. Our experimental results suggest that the formalization
of market views significantly increases the profitability (5% to 10% annually)
of the simulated portfolio at a given risk level.

1421,Ergodicity analysis and antithetic integral control of a class of stochastic reaction networks with delays,"  Delays are an important phenomenon arising in a wide variety of real world
systems. They occur in biological models because of diffusion effects or as
simplifying modeling elements. We propose here to consider delayed stochastic
reaction networks. The difficulty here lies in the fact that the state-space of
a delayed reaction network is infinite-dimensional, which makes their analysis
more involved. We demonstrate here that a particular class of stochastic
time-varying delays, namely those that follow a phase-type distribution, can be
exactly implemented in terms of a chemical reaction network. Hence, any
delay-free network can be augmented to incorporate those delays through the
addition of delay-species and delay-reactions. Hence, for this class of
stochastic delays, which can be used to approximate any delay distribution
arbitrarily accurately, the state-space remains finite-dimensional and,
therefore, standard tools developed for standard reaction network still apply.
In particular, we demonstrate that for unimolecular mass-action reaction
networks that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if
the non-delayed network is ergodic as well. Bimolecular reactions are more
difficult to consider but an analogous result is also obtained. These results
tell us that delays that are phase-type distributed, regardless of their
distribution, are not harmful to the ergodicity property of reaction networks.
We also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the
moment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared
to the delay-free case. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed
stochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is
considered. It is proven that this controller achieves its goal provided that
the delay-free network satisfy the conditions of ergodicity and
output-controllability.

connectome has been widely studied. Network theoretical measures and certain
topological principles are computed from the entire brain, however there is a
need to separate and understand the underlying subnetworks which contribute
towards these observed holistic connectomic alterations. One organizational
principle is the rich-club - a core subnetwork of brain regions that are
strongly connected, forming a high-cost, high-capacity backbone that is
critical for effective communication in the network. Investigations primarily
focus on its alterations with disease and age. Here, we present a systematic
analysis of not only the rich-club, but also other subnetworks derived from
this backbone - namely feeder and seeder subnetworks. Our analysis is applied
to structural connectomes in a normal cohort from a large, publicly available
lifespan study. We demonstrate changes in rich-club membership with age
alongside a shift in importance from 'peripheral' seeder to feeder subnetworks.
Our results show a refinement within the rich-club structure (increase in
transitivity and betweenness centrality), as well as increased efficiency in
the feeder subnetwork and decreased measures of network integration and
segregation in the seeder subnetwork. These results demonstrate the different
developmental patterns when analyzing the connectome stratified according to
its rich-club and the potential of utilizing this subnetwork analysis to reveal
the evolution of brain architectural alterations across the life-span.

1423,Determinants of cyclization-decyclization kinetics of short DNA with sticky ends,"  Cyclization of DNA with sticky ends is commonly used to construct DNA
minicircles and to measure DNA bendability. The cyclization probability of
short DNA (< 150 bp) has a strong length dependence, but how it depends on the
rotational positioning of the sticky ends around the helical axis is less
clear. To shed light upon the determinants of the cyclization probability of
short DNA, we measured cyclization and decyclization rates of ~100-bp DNA with
sticky ends over two helical periods using single-molecule Fluorescence
Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The cyclization rate increases monotonically
with length, indicating no excess twisting, while the decyclization rate
oscillates with length, higher at half-integer helical turns and lower at
integer helical turns. The oscillation profile is kinetically and
thermodynamically consistent with a three-state cyclization model in which
sticky-ended short DNA first bends into a torsionally-relaxed teardrop, and
subsequently transitions to a more stable loop upon terminal base stacking. We
also show that the looping probability density (the J factor) extracted from
this study is in good agreement with the worm-like chain model near 100 bp. For
shorter DNA, we discuss various experimental factors that prevent an accurate
measurement of the J factor.

1424,When few survive to tell the tale: thymus and gonad as auditioning organs: historical overview,"  Unlike other organs, the thymus and gonads generate non-uniform cell
populations, many members of which perish, and a few survive. While it is
recognized that thymic cells are 'audited' to optimize an organism's immune
repertoire, whether gametogenesis could be orchestrated similarly to favour
high quality gametes is uncertain. Ideally, such quality would be affirmed at
early stages before the commitment of extensive parental resources. A case is
here made that, along the lines of a previously proposed lymphocyte quality
control mechanism, gamete quality can be registered indirectly through
detection of incompatibilities between proteins encoded by the grandparental
DNA sequences within the parent from which haploid gametes are meiotically
derived. This 'stress test' is achieved in the same way that thymic screening
for potential immunological incompatibilities is achieved - by 'promiscuous'
expression, under the influence of the AIRE protein, of the products of genes
that are not normally specific for that organ. Consistent with this, the Aire
gene is expressed in both thymus and gonads, and AIRE deficiency impedes
function in both organs. While not excluding the subsequent emergence of hybrid
incompatibilities due to the intermixing of genomic sequences from parents
(rather than grandparents), many observations, such as the number of proteins
that are aberrantly expressed during gametogenesis, can be explained on this
basis. Indeed, promiscuous expression could have first evolved in
gamete-forming cells where incompatible proteins would be manifest as aberrant
protein aggregates that cause apoptosis. This mechanism would later have been
co-opted by thymic epithelial cells which display peptides from aggregates to
remove potentially autoreactive T cells.

1429,How Criticality of Gene Regulatory Networks Affects the Resulting Morphogenesis under Genetic Perturbations,"  Whereas the relationship between criticality of gene regulatory networks
(GRNs) and dynamics of GRNs at a single cell level has been vigorously studied,
the relationship between the criticality of GRNs and system properties at a
higher level has remained unexplored. Here we aim at revealing a potential role
of criticality of GRNs at a multicellular level which are hard to uncover
through the single-cell-level studies, especially from an evolutionary
viewpoint. Our model simulated the growth of a cell population from a single
seed cell. All the cells were assumed to have identical GRNs. We induced
genetic perturbations to the GRN of the seed cell by adding, deleting, or
switching a regulatory link between a pair of genes. From numerical
simulations, we found that the criticality of GRNs facilitated the formation of
nontrivial morphologies when the GRNs were critical in the presence of the
evolutionary perturbations. Moreover, the criticality of GRNs produced
topologically homogenous cell clusters by adjusting the spatial arrangements of
cells, which led to the formation of nontrivial morphogenetic patterns. Our
findings corresponded to an epigenetic viewpoint that heterogeneous and complex
features emerge from homogeneous and less complex components through the
interactions among them. Thus, our results imply that highly structured tissues
or organs in morphogenesis of multicellular organisms might stem from the
criticality of GRNs.

state-of-the-art for object classification tasks such as ImageNet. Further,
they are quantitatively accurate models of temporally-averaged responses of
neurons in the primate brain's visual system. However, biological visual
systems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical
CNNs: local recurrence within cortical areas, and long-range feedback from
downstream areas to upstream areas. Here we explored the role of recurrence in
improving classification performance. We found that standard forms of
recurrence (vanilla RNNs and LSTMs) do not perform well within deep CNNs on the
ImageNet task. In contrast, novel cells that incorporated two structural
features, bypassing and gating, were able to boost task accuracy substantially.
We extended these design principles in an automated search over thousands of
model architectures, which identified novel local recurrent cells and
long-range feedback connections useful for object recognition. Moreover, these
task-optimized ConvRNNs matched the dynamics of neural activity in the primate
visual system better than feedforward networks, suggesting a role for the
brain's recurrent connections in performing difficult visual behaviors.

1431,Self-organization principles of intracellular pattern formation,"  Dynamic patterning of specific proteins is essential for the spatiotemporal
regulation of many important intracellular processes in procaryotes,
eucaryotes, and multicellular organisms. The emergence of patterns generated by
interactions of diffusing proteins is a paradigmatic example for
self-organization. In this article we review quantitative models for
intracellular Min protein patterns in E. coli, Cdc42 polarization in S.
cerevisiae, and the bipolar PAR protein patterns found in C. elegans. By
analyzing the molecular processes driving these systems we derive a theoretical
perspective on general principles underlying self-organized pattern formation.
We argue that intracellular pattern formation is not captured by concepts such
as ""activators""', ""inhibitors"", or ""substrate-depletion"". Instead,
intracellular pattern formation is based on the redistribution of proteins by
cytosolic diffusion, and the cycling of proteins between distinct
conformational states. Therefore, mass-conserving reaction-diffusion equations
provide the most appropriate framework to study intracellular pattern
formation. We conclude that directed transport, e.g. cytosolic diffusion along
an actively maintained cytosolic gradient, is the key process underlying
pattern formation. Thus the basic principle of self-organization is the
establishment and maintenance of directed transport by intracellular protein
dynamics.

multicellular organisms, although a comprehensive theory of biological pattern
formation is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model combining tissue
mechanics to morphogen turnover and transport in order to explore new routes to
patterning. Our active description couples morphogen reaction-diffusion, which
impact on cell differentiation and tissue mechanics, to a two-phase poroelastic
rheology, where one tissue phase consists of a poroelastic cell network and the
other of a permeating extracellular fluid, which provides a feedback by
actively transporting morphogens. While this model encompasses previous
theories approximating tissues to inert monophasic media, such as Turing's
reaction-diffusion model, it overcomes some of their key limitations permitting
pattern formation via any two-species biochemical kinetics thanks to
mechanically induced cross-diffusion flows. Moreover, we describe a
qualitatively different advection-driven Keller-Segel instability which allows
for the formation of patterns with a single morphogen, and whose fundamental
mode pattern robustly scales with tissue size. We discuss the potential
relevance of these findings for tissue morphogenesis.

properties of financial systems. The analysis of the structure of investment
portfolios is a major application since their eventual correlation and overlap
impact the actual risk diversification by individual investors. We investigate
the bipartite network of US mutual fund portfolios and their assets. We follow
its evolution during the Global Financial Crisis and analyse the interplay
between diversification, as understood in classical portfolio theory, and
similarity of the investments of different funds. We show that, on average,
portfolios have become more diversified and less similar during the crisis.
However, we also find that large overlap is far more likely than expected from
models of random allocation of investments. This indicates the existence of
strong correlations between fund portfolio strategies. We introduce a
simplified model of propagation of financial shocks, that we exploit to show
that a systemic risk component origins from the similarity of portfolios. The
network is still vulnerable after crisis because of this effect, despite the
increase in the diversification of portfolios. Our results indicate that
diversification may even increase systemic risk when funds diversify in the
same way. Diversification and similarity can play antagonistic roles and the
trade-off between the two should be taken into account to properly assess
systemic risk.

Astrocytes play a pivotal role, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. No
early postnatal treatment strategies exist to enhance neuroprotective potential
of astrocytes. We hypothesized that agonism on {\alpha}7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor ({\alpha}7nAChR) in fetal astrocytes will augment their
neuroprotective transcriptome profile, while the antagonistic stimulation of
{\alpha}7nAChR will achieve the opposite. Using an in vivo - in vitro model of
developmental programming of neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), we validated this hypothesis in primary fetal sheep astrocytes cultures
re-exposed to LPS in presence of a selective {\alpha}7nAChR agonist or
antagonist. Our RNAseq findings show that a pro-inflammatory astrocyte
transcriptome phenotype acquired in vitro by LPS stimulation is reversed with
{\alpha}7nAChR agonistic stimulation. Conversely, antagonistic {\alpha}7nAChR
stimulation potentiates the pro-inflammatory astrocytic transcriptome
phenotype. Furthermore, we conduct a secondary transcriptome analysis against
the identical {\alpha}7nAChR experiments in fetal sheep primary microglia
cultures and against the Simons Simplex Collection for autism spectrum disorder
and discuss the implications.

evaluate the water quality of the IgapÃƒÂ³ I Lake, in Londrina, ParanÃƒÂ¡ State,
Brazil. The simulation was conducted by means of the discretization in
curvilinear coordinates of the geometry of IgapÃƒÂ³ I Lake, together with finite
difference and finite element methods. The evaluation of the proposed numerical
model for water quality was performed by comparing the experimental values of
BOD5 with the numerical results. The evaluation of the model showed
quantitative results compatible with the actual behavior of IgapÃƒÂ³ I Lake in
relation to the simulated parameter. The qualitative analysis of the numerical
simulations provided a better understanding of the dynamics of the BOD5
concentration at IgapÃƒÂ³ I Lake, showing that such concentrations in the
central regions of the lake have values above those allowed by Brazilian law.
The results can help to guide choices by public officials, as: (i) improve the
identification mechanisms of pollutant emitters on Lake IgapÃƒÂ³ I, (ii)
contribute to the optimal treatment of the recovery of the polluted environment
and (iii) provide a better quality of life for the regulars of the lake as well
as for the residents living on the lakeside.

1436,Involvement of Surfactant Protein D in Ebola Virus Infection Enhancement via Glycoprotein Interaction,"  Since the largest 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa,
understanding of Ebola virus infection has improved, notably the involvement of
innate immune mediators. Amongst them, collectins are important players in the
antiviral innate immune defense. A screening of Ebola glycoprotein
(GP)-collectins interactions revealed the specific interaction of human
surfactant protein D (hSP-D), a lectin expressed in lung and liver, two
compartments where Ebola was found in vivo. Further analyses have demonstrated
an involvement of hSP-D in the enhancement of virus infection in several in
vitro models. Similar effects were observed for porcine SP-D (pSP-D). In
addition, both hSP-D and pSP-D interacted with Reston virus (RESTV) GP and
enhanced pseudoviral infection in pulmonary cells. Thus, our study reveals a
novel partner of Ebola GP that may participate to enhance viral spread.

1437,Maximum entropy and population heterogeneity in continuous cell cultures,"  Continuous cultures of mammalian cells are complex systems displaying
hallmark phenomena of nonlinear dynamics, such as multi-stability, hysteresis,
as well as sharp transitions between different metabolic states. In this
context mathematical models may suggest control strategies to steer the system
towards desired states. Although even clonal populations are known to exhibit
cell-to-cell variability, most of the currently studied models assume that the
population is homogeneous. To overcome this limitation, we use the maximum
entropy principle to model the phenotypic distribution of cells in a chemostat
as a function of the dilution rate. We consider the coupling between cell
metabolism and extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor
and take into account the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation on cell
viability. We present a formal solution for the stationary state of the
chemostat and show how to apply it in two examples. First, a simplified model
of cell metabolism where the exact solution is tractable, and then a
genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Along the way we discuss several consequences of heterogeneity, such as:
qualitative changes in the dynamical landscape of the system, increasing
concentrations of byproducts that vanish in the homogeneous case, and larger
population sizes.

1439,Sampling-based probabilistic inference emerges from learning in neural circuits with a cost on reliability,"  Neural responses in the cortex change over time both systematically, due to
ongoing plasticity and learning, and seemingly randomly, due to various sources
of noise and variability. Most previous work considered each of these
processes, learning and variability, in isolation -- here we study neural
networks exhibiting both and show that their interaction leads to the emergence
of powerful computational properties. We trained neural networks on classical
unsupervised learning tasks, in which the objective was to represent their
inputs in an efficient, easily decodable form, with an additional cost for
neural reliability which we derived from basic biophysical considerations. This
cost on reliability introduced a tradeoff between energetically cheap but
inaccurate representations and energetically costly but accurate ones. Despite
the learning tasks being non-probabilistic, the networks solved this tradeoff
by developing a probabilistic representation: neural variability represented
samples from statistically appropriate posterior distributions that would
result from performing probabilistic inference over their inputs. We provide an
analytical understanding of this result by revealing a connection between the
cost of reliability, and the objective for a state-of-the-art Bayesian
inference strategy: variational autoencoders. We show that the same cost leads
to the emergence of increasingly accurate probabilistic representations as
networks become more complex, from single-layer feed-forward, through
multi-layer feed-forward, to recurrent architectures. Our results provide
insights into why neural responses in sensory areas show signatures of
sampling-based probabilistic representations, and may inform future deep
learning algorithms and their implementation in stochastic low-precision
computing systems.

1440,Topological Brain Network Distances,"  Existing brain network distances are often based on matrix norms. The
element-wise differences in the existing matrix norms may fail to capture
underlying topological differences. Further, matrix norms are sensitive to
outliers. A major disadvantage to element-wise distance calculations is that it
could be severely affected even by a small number of extreme edge weights. Thus
it is necessary to develop network distances that recognize topology. In this
paper, we provide a survey of bottleneck, Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distances that are adapted for brain networks, and
compare them against matrix-norm based network distances. Bottleneck and
GH-distances are often used in persistent homology. However, they were rarely
utilized to measure similarity between brain networks. KS-distance is recently
introduced to measure the similarity between networks across different
filtration values. The performance analysis was conducted using the random
network simulations with the ground truths. Using a twin imaging study, which
provides biological ground truth, we demonstrate that the KS distance has the
ability to determine heritability.

dodecahedral capsid with $12$ corresponding packaging signals in three affinity

been explored via computationally expensive stochastic assembly models, giving
a fitness landscape in terms of the assembly efficiency. Using latest
machine-learning techniques by establishing a neural network, we show that the

1442,Signal propagation in sensing and reciprocating cellular systems with spatial and structural heterogeneity,"  Sensing and reciprocating cellular systems (SARs) are important for the
operation of many biological systems. Production in interferon (IFN) SARs is
achieved through activation of the Jak-Stat pathway, and downstream
upregulation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IFN transcription, but the
role that high and low affinity IFNs play in this process remains unclear. We
present a comparative between a minimal spatio-temporal partial differential
equation (PDE) model and a novel spatio-structural-temporal (SST) model for the
consideration of receptor, binding, and metabolic aspects of SAR behaviour.
Using the SST framework, we simulate single- and multi-cluster paradigms of IFN
communication. Simulations reveal a cyclic process between the binding of IFN
to the receptor, and the consequent increase in metabolism, decreasing the
propensity for binding due to the internal feed-back mechanism. One observes
the effect of heterogeneity between cellular clusters, allowing them to
individualise and increase local production, and within clusters, where we
observe `sub popular quiescence'; a process whereby intra-cluster
subpopulations reduce their binding and metabolism such that other such
subpopulations may augment their production. Finally, we observe the ability
for low affinity IFN to communicate a long range signal, where high affinity
cannot, and the breakdown of this relationship through the introduction of cell
motility. Biological systems may utilise cell motility where environments are
unrestrictive and may use fixed system, with low affinity communication, where
a localised response is desirable.

1443,Nutrients and biomass dynamics in photo-sequencing batch reactors treating wastewater with high nutrients loadings,"  The present study investigates different strategies for the treatment of a
mixture of digestate from an anaerobic digester diluted and secondary effluent
from a high rate algal pond. To this aim, the performance of two
photo-sequencing batch reactors (PSBRs) operated at high nutrients loading
rates and different solids retention times (SRTs) were compared with a
semi-continuous photobioreactor (SC). Performances were evaluated in terms of
wastewater treatment, biomass composition and biopolymers accumulation during
30 days of operation. PSBRs were operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT)
of 2 days and SRTs of 10 and 5 days (PSBR2-10 and PSBR2-5, respectively),
whereas the semi-continuous reactor was operated at a coupled HRT/SRT of 10
days (SC10-10). Results showed that PSBR2-5 achieved the highest removal rates
in terms of TN (6.7 mg L-1 d-1), TP (0.31 mg L-1 d-1), TOC (29.32 mg L-1 d-1)
and TIC (3.91 mg L-1 d-1). These results were in general 3-6 times higher than
the removal rates obtained in the SC10-10 (TN 29.74 mg L-1 d-1, TP 0.96 mg L-1
d-1, TOC 29.32 mg L-1 d-1 and TIC 3.91 mg L-1 d-1). Furthermore, both PSBRs
were able to produce biomass up to 0.09 g L-1 d-1, more than twofold the
biomass produced by the semi-continuous reactor (0.04 g L-1 d-1), and achieved
a biomass settleability of 86-92%. This study also demonstrated that the
microbial composition could be controlled by the nutrients loads, since the
three reactors were dominated by different species depending on the nutritional
conditions. Concerning biopolymers accumulation, carbohydrates concentration
achieved similar values in the three reactors (11%), whereas <0.5 % of
polyhydrohybutyrates (PHB) was produced. These low values in biopolymers
production could be related to the lack of microorganisms as cyanobacteria that
are able to accumulate carbohydrates/PHB.

of theoretical realized variance for Heston and multiplicative models of

university knowledge? Research on this topic seldom considers the impact of the
institutional environment, especially when a formal institution for encouraging
the commercial activities of scholars has not yet been established. This study
investigates this question in the context of China, which is in the
institutional transition stage. Based on a survey of scholars from Shanghai
Maritime University, we demonstrate that academic engagement has a positive
impact on commercialization and that this impact is greater for risk-averse
scholars than for other risk-seeking scholars. Our results suggest that in an
institutional transition environment, the government should consider
encouraging academic engagement to stimulate the commercialization activities
of conservative scholars.

1446,Multi-agent Economics and the Emergence of Critical Markets,"  The dual crises of the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the global financial
crisis has prompted a call for explanations of non-equilibrium market dynamics.
Recently a promising approach has been the use of agent based models (ABMs) to
simulate aggregate market dynamics. A key aspect of these models is the
endogenous emergence of critical transitions between equilibria, i.e. market
collapses, caused by multiple equilibria and changing market parameters.
Several research themes have developed microeconomic based models that include
multiple equilibria: social decision theory (Brock and Durlauf), quantal
response models (McKelvey and Palfrey), and strategic complementarities
(Goldstein). A gap that needs to be filled in the literature is a unified
analysis of the relationship between these models and how aggregate criticality
emerges from the individual agent level. This article reviews the agent-based
foundations of markets starting with the individual agent perspective of
McFadden and the aggregate perspective of catastrophe theory emphasising
connections between the different approaches. It is shown that changes in the
uncertainty agents have in the value of their interactions with one another,
even if these changes are one-sided, plays a central role in systemic market
risks such as market instability and the twin crises effect. These interactions
can endogenously cause crises that are an emergent phenomena of markets.

credit scoring by using ""private information"" about communications and travels
of borrowers. We found that P2P borrowers' ego networks exhibit scale-free
behavior driven by underlying preferential attachment mechanisms that connect
borrowers in a fashion that can be used to predict loan profitability. The
projection of these private networks onto networks of mobile phone
communication and geographical locations from mobile phone GPS potentially give
loan providers access to private information through graph and location metrics
which we used to predict loan profitability. Graph topology was found to be an
important predictor of loan profitability, explaining over 5.5% of variability.
Networks of borrower location information explain an additional 19% of the
profitability. Machine learning algorithms were applied to the data set
previously analyzed to develop the predictive model and resulted in a 4%

1450,Effects of a Price limit Change on Market Stability at the Intraday Horizon in the Korean Stock Market,"  This paper investigates the effects of a price limit change on the volatility
of the Korean stock market's (KRX) intraday stock price process. Based on the
most recent transaction data from the KRX, which experienced a change in the
price limit on June 15, 2015, we examine the change in realized variance after
the price limit change to investigate the overall effects of the change on the
intraday market volatility. We then analyze the effects in more detail by
applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the data set. We find evidence
that the market becomes more volatile in the intraday horizon because of the
increase in the amplitudes of the low-frequency components of the price
processes after the price limit change. Therefore, liquidity providers are in a
worse situation than they were prior to the change.

1452,Disentangling and Assessing Uncertainties in Multiperiod Corporate Default Risk Predictions,"  Measuring the corporate default risk is broadly important in economics and
finance. Quantitative methods have been developed to predictively assess future
corporate default probabilities. However, as a more difficult yet crucial
problem, evaluating the uncertainties associated with the default predictions
remains little explored. In this paper, we attempt to fill this blank by
developing a procedure for quantifying the level of associated uncertainties
upon carefully disentangling multiple contributing sources. Our framework
effectively incorporates broad information from historical default data,
corporates' financial records, and macroeconomic conditions by a)
characterizing the default mechanism, and b) capturing the future dynamics of
various features contributing to the default mechanism. Our procedure overcomes
the major challenges in this large scale statistical inference problem and
makes it practically feasible by using parsimonious models, innovative methods,
and modern computational facilities. By predicting the marketwide total number
of defaults and assessing the associated uncertainties, our method can also be
applied for evaluating the aggregated market credit risk level. Upon analyzing
a US market data set, we demonstrate that the level of uncertainties associated
with default risk assessments is indeed substantial. More informatively, we
also find that the level of uncertainties associated with the default risk
predictions is correlated with the level of default risks, indicating potential
for new scopes in practical applications including improving the accuracy of
default risk assessments.

1454,A Community Microgrid Architecture with an Internal Local Market,"  This work fits in the context of community microgrids, where members of a
community can exchange energy and services among themselves, without going
through the usual channels of the public electricity grid. We introduce and
analyze a framework to operate a community microgrid, and to share the
resulting revenues and costs among its members. A market-oriented pricing of
energy exchanges within the community is obtained by implementing an internal
local market based on the marginal pricing scheme. The market aims at
maximizing the social welfare of the community, thanks to the more efficient
allocation of resources, the reduction of the peak power to be paid, and the
increased amount of reserve, achieved at an aggregate level. A community
microgrid operator, acting as a benevolent planner, redistributes revenues and
costs among the members, in such a way that the solution achieved by each
member within the community is not worse than the solution it would achieve by
acting individually. In this way, each member is incentivized to participate in
the community on a voluntary basis. The overall framework is formulated in the
form of a bilevel model, where the lower level problem clears the market, while
the upper level problem plays the role of the community microgrid operator.
Numerical results obtained on a real test case implemented in Belgium show
significant cost savings on a yearly scale for the community members, as
compared to the case when they act individually.

1456,Strong and Weak Equilibria for Time-Inconsistent Stochastic Control in Continuous Time,"  A new definition of continuous-time equilibrium controls is introduced. As
opposed to the standard definition, which involves a derivative-type operation,
the new definition parallels how a discrete-time equilibrium is defined, and
allows for unambiguous economic interpretation. The terms ""strong equilibria""
and ""weak equilibria"" are coined for controls under the new and the standard
definitions, respectively. When the state process is a time-homogeneous
continuous-time Markov chain, a careful asymptotic analysis gives complete
characterizations of weak and strong equilibria. Thanks to Kakutani-Fan's
fixed-point theorem, general existence of weak and strong equilibria is also
established, under additional compactness assumption. Our theoretic results are
applied to a two-state model under non-exponential discounting. In particular,
we demonstrate explicitly that there can be incentive to deviate from a weak
equilibrium, which justifies the need for strong equilibria. Our analysis also
provides new results for the existence and characterization of discrete-time
equilibria under infinite horizon.

factors. This paper analyses how to optimally trade with latent factors that
cause prices to jump and diffuse. Moreover, we account for the effect of the
trader's actions on quoted prices and the prices they receive from trading.
Under fairly general assumptions, we demonstrate how the trader can learn the
posterior distribution over the latent states, and explicitly solve the latent
optimal trading problem. We provide a verification theorem, and a methodology
for calibrating the model by deriving a variation of the
expectation-maximization algorithm. To illustrate the efficacy of the optimal
strategy, we demonstrate its performance through simulations and compare it to
strategies which ignore learning in the latent factors. We also provide
calibration results for a particular model using Intel Corporation stock as an

close analogy with the physiological neuromodulation of a single neuron. The
methodology is general in that it only relies on a parallel interconnection of
elementary voltage-controlled current sources. In contrast to controlling a
nonlinear circuit through the parameter tuning of a state-space model, our
approach is purely input-output. The circuit elements are controlled and
interconnected to shape the current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) of the
circuit in prescribed timescales. In turn, shaping those I-V curves determines
the excitability properties of the circuit. We show that this methodology
enables both robust and accurate control of the circuit behavior and resembles
the biophysical mechanisms of neuromodulation. As a proof of concept, we
simulate a SPICE model composed of MOSFET transconductance amplifiers operating
in the weak inversion regime.

intriguing properties of collective behaviour in starling flocks, namely the
fact that strong collective order of the system coexists with scale-free
correlations of the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom, that is the
birds' speeds. The key idea of the new theory is that the single-particle
potential needed to bound the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom
around a finite value, is marginal, that is has zero curvature. We study the
model by using mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations in three
dimensions, complemented by finite-size scaling analysis. While at the standard
critical temperature, $T_c$, the properties of the marginal model are exactly
the same as a normal ferromagnet with continuous symmetry-breaking, our results
show that a novel zero-temperature critical point emerges, so that in its
deeply ordered phase the marginal model develops divergent susceptibility and
correlation length of the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom, in
complete analogy with experimental data on natural flocks of starlings.

resulting in a rich source of untapped new knowledge. Most biomedical facts are
however not readily available, but buried in the form of unstructured text, and
hence their exploitation requires the time-consuming manual curation of
published articles. Here we present INtERAcT, a novel approach to extract
protein-protein interactions from a corpus of biomedical articles related to a
broad range of scientific domains in a completely unsupervised way. INtERAcT
exploits vector representation of words, computed on a corpus of domain
specific knowledge, and implements a new metric that estimates an interaction
score between two molecules in the space where the corresponding words are
embedded. We demonstrate the power of INtERAcT by reconstructing the molecular
pathways associated to 10 different cancer types using a corpus of
disease-specific articles for each cancer type. We evaluate INtERAcT using
STRING database as a benchmark, and show that our metric outperforms currently
adopted approaches for similarity computation at the task of identifying known
molecular interactions in all studied cancer types. Furthermore, our approach
does not require text annotation, manual curation or the definition of semantic
rules based on expert knowledge, and hence it can be easily and efficiently
applied to different scientific domains. Our findings suggest that INtERAcT may
increase our capability to summarize the understanding of a specific disease
using the published literature in an automated and completely unsupervised
fashion.

considered encompass parameter regime shifts and stochastic volatility. The
filter adapts to regime shifts extremely rapidly and delivers a clear heuristic
for distinguishing between regime shifts and stochastic volatility, even though
the model dynamics assumed by the filter exhibit neither of those features.

of biological systems. Such principles, if they exist, can help us better
understand complex, natural biological systems and guide the engineering of de

biological systems with proper abstraction is a promising approach. Here, we
demonstrate the application of in silico evolution combined with rule-based
modelling for exploring design principles of cellular signaling networks. This
application is based on a computational platform, called BioJazz, which allows
in silico evolution of signaling networks with unbounded complexity. We provide
a detailed introduction to BioJazz architecture and implementation and describe
how it can be used to evolve and/or design signaling networks with defined
dynamics. For the latter, we evolve signaling networks with switch-like
response dynamics and demonstrate how BioJazz can result in new biological
insights on network structures that can endow bistable response dynamics. This
example also demonstrated both the power of BioJazz in evolving and designing
signaling networks and its limitations at the current stage of development.

there are numerous shortcomings associated with collecting
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals in real-world environments. These include,
but are not limited to, subject and session data variance, long and arduous
calibration processes and performance generalisation issues across
differentsubjects or sessions. This implies that many downstream applications,
including Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based classification
systems, can suffer from a shortage of reliable data. Generating meaningful and
realistic synthetic data can therefore be of significant value in circumventing
this problem. We explore the use of modern neural-based generative models
trained on a limited quantity of EEG data collected from different subjects to
generate supplementary synthetic EEG signal vectors subsequently utilised to
train an SSVEP classifier. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate the

1465,A quick guide for student-driven community genome annotation,"  High quality gene models are necessary to expand the molecular and genetic
tools available for a target organism, but these are available for only a
handful of model organisms that have undergone extensive curation and
experimental validation over the course of many years. The majority of gene
models present in biological databases today have been identified in draft
genome assemblies using automated annotation pipelines that are frequently
based on orthologs from distantly related model organisms. Manual curation is
time consuming and often requires substantial expertise, but is instrumental in
improving gene model structure and identification. Manual annotation may seem
to be a daunting and cost-prohibitive task for small research communities but
involving undergraduates in community genome annotation consortiums can be
mutually beneficial for both education and improved genomic resources. We
outline a workflow for efficient manual annotation driven by a team of
primarily undergraduate annotators. This model can be scaled to large teams and
includes quality control processes through incremental evaluation. Moreover, it
gives students an opportunity to increase their understanding of genome biology
and to participate in scientific research in collaboration with peers and
senior researchers at multiple institutions.

1466,Stochasticity from function - why the Bayesian brain may need no noise,"  An increasing body of evidence suggests that the trial-to-trial variability
of spiking activity in the brain is not mere noise, but rather the reflection
of a sampling-based encoding scheme for probabilistic computing. Since the
precise statistical properties of neural activity are important in this
context, many models assume an ad-hoc source of well-behaved, explicit noise,
either on the input or on the output side of single neuron dynamics, most often
assuming an independent Poisson process in either case. However, these
assumptions are somewhat problematic: neighboring neurons tend to share
receptive fields, rendering both their input and their output correlated; at
the same time, neurons are known to behave largely deterministically, as a
function of their membrane potential and conductance. We suggest that spiking
neural networks may, in fact, have no need for noise to perform sampling-based
Bayesian inference. We study analytically the effect of auto- and
cross-correlations in functionally Bayesian spiking networks and demonstrate
how their effect translates to synaptic interaction strengths, rendering them
controllable through synaptic plasticity. This allows even small ensembles of
interconnected deterministic spiking networks to simultaneously and
co-dependently shape their output activity through learning, enabling them to
perform complex Bayesian computation without any need for noise, which we
demonstrate in silico, both in classical simulation and in neuromorphic
emulation. These results close a gap between the abstract models and the
biology of functionally Bayesian spiking networks, effectively reducing the
architectural constraints imposed on physical neural substrates required to
perform probabilistic computing, be they biological or artificial.

1467,A quantized physical framework for understanding the working mechanism of ion channels,"  A quantized physical framework, called the five-anchor model, is developed
for a general understanding of the working mechanism of ion channels. According
to the hypotheses of this model, the following two basic physical principles
are assigned to each anchor: the polarity change induced by an electron
transition and the mutual repulsion and attraction induced by an electrostatic
force. Consequently, many unique phenomena, such as fast and slow inactivation,
the stochastic gating pattern and constant conductance of a single ion channel,
the difference between electrical and optical stimulation (optogenetics), nerve
conduction block and the generation of an action potential, become intrinsic
features of this physical model. Moreover, this model also provides a
foundation for the probability equation used to calculate the results of
electrical stimulation in our previous C-P theory.

1468,Eight-cluster structure of chloroplast genomes differs from similar one observed for bacteria,"  Previously, a seven-cluster pattern claiming to be a universal one in
bacterial genomes has been reported. Keeping in mind the most popular theory of
chloroplast origin, we checked whether a similar pattern is observed in
chloroplast genomes. Surprisingly, eight cluster structure has been found, for
chloroplasts. The pattern observed for chloroplasts differs rather
significantly, from bacterial one, and from that latter observed for
cyanobacteria. The structure is provided by clustering of the fragments of
equal length isolated within a genome so that each fragment is converted in
triplet frequency dictionary with non-overlapping triplets with no gaps in
frame tiling. The points in 63-dimensional space were clustered due to elastic
map technique. The eight cluster found in chloroplasts comprises the fragments
of a genome bearing tRNA genes and exhibiting excessively high
$\mathsf{GC}$-content, in comparison to the entire genome.

1469,PEBP1/RKIP: from multiple functions to a common role in cellular processes,"  PEBPs (PhosphatidylEthanolamine Binding Proteins) form a protein family
widely present in the living world since they are encountered in
microorganisms, plants and animals. In all organisms PEBPs appear to regulate
important mechanisms that govern cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation and
motility. In humans, three PEBPs have been identified, namely PEBP1, PEBP2 and
PEBP4. PEBP1 and PEBP4 are the most studied as they are implicated in the
development of various cancers. PEBP2 is specific of testes in mammals and was
essentially studied in rats and mice where it is very abundant. A lot of
information has been gained on PEBP1 also named RKIP (Raf Kinase Inhibitory
protein) due to its role as a metastasis suppressor in cancer. PEBP1 was also
demonstrated to be implicated in Alzheimers disease, diabetes and
nephropathies. Furthermore, PEBP1 was described to be involved in many cellular
processes, among them are signal transduction, inflammation, cell cycle,
proliferation, adhesion, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, circadian
rhythm and mitotic spindle checkpoint. On the molecular level, PEBP1 was shown
to regulate several signaling pathways such as Raf/MEK/ERK, NFkB,
PI3K/Akt/mTOR, p38, Notch and Wnt. PEBP1 acts by inhibiting most of the kinases
of these signaling cascades. Moreover, PEBP1 is able to bind to a variety of
small ligands such as ATP, phospholipids, nucleotides, flavonoids or drugs.
Considering PEBP1 is a small cytoplasmic protein (21kDa), its involvement in so
many diseases and cellular mechanisms is amazing. The aim of this review is to
highlight the molecular systems that are common to all these cellular
mechanisms in order to decipher the specific role of PEBP1. Recent discoveries
enable us to propose that PEBP1 is a modulator of molecular interactions that
control signal transduction during membrane and cytoskeleton reorganization.

1471,On the inherent competition between valid and spurious inductive inferences in Boolean data,"  Inductive inference is the process of extracting general rules from specific
observations. This problem also arises in the analysis of biological networks,
such as genetic regulatory networks, where the interactions are complex and the
observations are incomplete. A typical task in these problems is to extract
general interaction rules as combinations of Boolean covariates, that explain a
measured response variable. The inductive inference process can be considered
as an incompletely specified Boolean function synthesis problem. This
incompleteness of the problem will also generate spurious inferences, which are
a serious threat to valid inductive inference rules. Using random Boolean data
as a null model, here we attempt to measure the competition between valid and
spurious inductive inference rules from a given data set. We formulate two
greedy search algorithms, which synthesize a given Boolean response variable in
a sparse disjunct normal form, and respectively a sparse generalized algebraic
normal form of the variables from the observation data, and we evaluate
numerically their performance.

1472,Priority effects between annual and perennial plants,"  Dominance by annual plants has traditionally been considered a brief early
stage of ecological succession preceding inevitable dominance by competitive
perennials. A more recent, alternative view suggests that interactions between
annuals and perennials can result in priority effects, causing annual dominance
to persist if they are initially more common. Such priority effects would
complicate restoration of native perennial grasslands that have been invaded by
exotic annuals. However, the conditions under which these priority effects
occur remain unknown. Using a simple simulation model, we show that long-term
(500 years) priority effects are possible as long as the plants have low
fecundity and show an establishment-longevity tradeoff, with annuals having
competitive advantage over perennial seedlings. We also show that short-term
(up to 50 years) priority effects arise solely due to low fitness difference in
cases where perennials dominate in the long term. These results provide a
theoretical basis for predicting when restoration of annual-invaded grasslands
requires active removal of annuals and timely reintroduction of perennials.

1473,Joining and decomposing reaction networks,"  In systems and synthetic biology, much research has focused on the behavior
and design of single pathways, while, more recently, experimental efforts have
focused on how cross-talk (coupling two or more pathways) or inhibiting
molecular function (isolating one part of the pathway) affects systems-level
behavior. However, the theory for tackling these larger systems in general has
lagged behind. Here, we analyze how joining networks (e.g., cross-talk) or
decomposing networks (e.g., inhibition or knock-outs) affects three properties
that reaction networks may possess---identifiability (recoverability of
parameter values from data), steady-state invariants (relationships among
species concentrations at steady state, used in model selection), and
multistationarity (capacity for multiple steady states, which correspond to
multiple cell decisions). Specifically, we prove results that clarify, for a
network obtained by joining two smaller networks, how properties of the smaller
networks can be inferred from or can imply similar properties of the original
network. Our proofs use techniques from computational algebraic geometry,
including elimination theory and differential algebra.

1474,Relative energetics of acetyl-histidine protomers with and without Zn2+ and a benchmark of energy methods,"  We studied acetylhistidine (AcH), bare or microsolvated with a zinc cation by
simulations in isolation. First, a global search for minima of the potential
energy surface combining both, empirical and first-principles methods, is
performed individually for either one of five possible protonation states.
Comparing the most stable structures between tautomeric forms of negatively
charged AcH shows a clear preference for conformers with the neutral imidazole
ring protonated at the N-epsilon-2 atom. When adding a zinc cation to the
system, the situation is reversed and N-delta-1-protonated structures are
energetically more favorable. Obtained minima structures then served as basis
for a benchmark study to examine the goodness of commonly applied levels of
theory, i.e. force fields, semi-empirical methods, density-functional
approximations (DFA), and wavefunction-based methods with respect to high-level
coupled-cluster calculations, i.e. the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method. All tested force
fields and semi-empirical methods show a poor performance in reproducing the
energy hierarchies of conformers, in particular of systems involving the zinc
cation. Meta-GGA, hybrid, double hybrid DFAs, and the MP2 method are able to
describe the energetics of the reference method within chemical accuracy, i.e.
with a mean absolute error of less than 1kcal/mol. Best performance is found
for the double hybrid DFA B3LYP+XYG3 with a mean absolute error of 0.7 kcal/mol
and a maximum error of 1.8 kcal/mol. While MP2 performs similarly as
B3LYP+XYG3, computational costs, i.e. timings, are increased by a factor of 4
in comparison due to the large basis sets required for accurate results.

1475,Zero-Inflated Autoregressive Conditional Duration Model for Discrete Trade Durations with Excessive Zeros,"  In finance, durations between successive transactions are usually modeled by
the autoregressive conditional duration model based on a continuous
distribution omitting frequent zero values. Zero durations can be caused by
either split transactions or independent transactions. We propose a discrete
model allowing for excessive zero values based on the zero-inflated negative
binomial distribution with score dynamics. We establish the invertibility of
the score filter. Additionally, we derive sufficient conditions for the
consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood of the model
parameters. In an empirical study of DJIA stocks, we find that split
transactions cause on average 63% of zero values. Furthermore, the loss of
decimal places in the proposed model is less severe than incorrect treatment of
zero values in continuous models.

1476,Nonlinear Dynamics of Binocular Rivalry: A Comparative Study,"  When our eyes are presented with the same image, the brain processes it to
view it as a single coherent one. The lateral shift in the position of our
eyes, causes the two images to possess certain differences, which our brain
exploits for the purpose of depth perception and to gauge the size of objects
at different distances, a process commonly known as stereopsis. However, when
presented with two different visual stimuli, the visual awareness alternates.
This phenomenon of binocular rivalry is a result of competition between the
corresponding neuronal populations of the two eyes. The article presents a
comparative study of various dynamical models proposed to capture this process.
It goes on to study the effect of a certain parameter on the rate of perceptual
alternations and proceeds to disprove the initial propositions laid down to
characterise this phenomenon. It concludes with a discussion on the possible
future work that can be conducted to obtain a better picture of the neuronal
functioning behind this rivalry.

1477,Optimized Bacteria are Environmental Prediction Engines,"  Experimentalists have observed phenotypic variability in isogenic bacteria
populations. We explore the hypothesis that in fluctuating environments this
variability is tuned to maximize a bacterium's expected log growth rate,
potentially aided by epigenetic markers that store information about past
environments. We show that, in a complex, memoryful environment, the maximal
expected log growth rate is linear in the instantaneous predictive
information---the mutual information between a bacterium's epigenetic markers
and future environmental states. Hence, under resource constraints, optimal
epigenetic markers are causal states---the minimal sufficient statistics for
prediction. This is the minimal amount of information about the past needed to
predict the future as well as possible. We suggest new theoretical
investigations into and new experiments on bacteria phenotypic bet-hedging in
fluctuating complex environments.

1478,Collective Dynamics of Self-propelled Semiflexible Filaments,"  The collective behavior of active semiflexible filaments is studied with a
model of tangentially driven self-propelled worm-like chains. The combination
of excluded-volume interactions and self-propulsion leads to several distinct
dynamic phases as a function of bending rigidity, activity, and aspect ratio of
individual filaments. We consider first the case of intermediate filament
density. For high-aspect-ratio filaments, we identify a transition with
increasing propulsion from a state of free-swimming filaments to a state of
spiraled filaments with nearly frozen translational motion. For lower aspect
ratios, this gas-of-spirals phase is suppressed with growing density due to
filament collisions; instead, filaments form clusters similar to self-propelled
rods, as activity increases. Finite bending rigidity strongly effects the
dynamics and phase behavior. Flexible filaments form small and transient
clusters, while stiffer filaments organize into giant clusters, similarly as
self-propelled rods, but with a reentrant phase behavior from giant to smaller
clusters as activity becomes large enough to bend the filaments. For high
filament densities, we identify a nearly frozen jamming state at low
activities, a nematic laning state at intermediate activities, and an
active-turbulence state at high activities. The latter state is characterized
by a power-law decay of the energy spectrum as a function of wave number. The
resulting phase diagrams encapsulate tunable non-equilibrium steady states that
can be used in the organization of living matter.

and Lee show how to robustly price and replicate a variety of claims written on
the quadratic variation of a risky asset under the assumption that the asset's
volatility process is independent of the Brownian motion that drives the
asset's price. Additionally, they propose a correlation immunization method
that minimizes the pricing and hedging error that results when the correlation
between the risky asset's price and volatility is nonzero. In this paper, we
perform a number of Monte Carlo experiments to test the effectiveness of Carr
and Lee's immunization strategy. Our results indicate that the correlation
immunization method is an effective means of reducing pricing and hedging
errors that result from nonzero correlation.

1480,Universal fitness dynamics through an adaptive resource utilization model,"  The fitness of a species determines its abundance and survival in an
ecosystem. At the same time, species take up resources for growth, so their
abundance affects the availability of resources in an ecosystem. We show here
that such species-resource coupling can be used to assign a quantitative metric
for fitness to each species. This fitness metric also allows for the modeling
of drift in species composition, and hence ecosystem evolution through
speciation and adaptation. Our results provide a foundation for an entirely
computational exploration of evolutionary ecosystem dynamics on any length or
time scale. For example, we can evolve ecosystem dynamics even by initiating
dynamics out of a single primordial ancestor and show that there exists a well
defined ecosystem-averaged fitness dynamics that is resilient against resource
shocks.

the study of a wide range of diseases. Machine learning and statistical
analysis techniques can inform how to allocate limited resources to the
considerable time and cost associated with wet lab mutagenesis experiments. In
this work we explore the effectiveness of using a neural network classifier to
predict the change in the stability of a protein due to a mutation. Assessing
the accuracy of our approach is dependent on the use of experimental data about
the effects of mutations performed in vitro. Because the experimental data is
prone to discrepancies when similar experiments have been performed by multiple
laboratories, the use of the data near the juncture of stabilizing and
destabilizing mutations is questionable. We address this later problem via a
systematic approach in which we explore the use of a three-way classification
scheme with stabilizing, destabilizing, and inconclusive labels. For a
systematic search of potential classification cutoff values our classifier
achieved 68 percent accuracy on ternary classification for cutoff values of
-0.6 and 0.7 with a low rate of classifying stabilizing as destabilizing and
vice versa.

the variables in the other set have the parameters

results from Random Matrix Theory, we argue that such networks generically
become unstable when their size increases, or when the heterogeneity in
productivities/connectivities becomes too strong. At marginal stability and for
large heterogeneities, we find that the distribution of firm sizes develops a
power-law tail, as observed empirically. Crises can be triggered by small
idiosyncratic shocks, which lead to ""avalanches"" of defaults characterized by a
power-law distribution of total output losses. We conjecture that evolutionary
and behavioural forces conspire to keep the economy close to marginal
stability. This scenario would naturally explain the well-known ""small shocks,
large business cycles"" puzzle, as anticipated long ago by Bak, Chen, Scheinkman

1487,"A streamlined, general approach for computing ligand binding free energies and its application to GPCR-bound cholesterol","  The theory of receptor-ligand binding equilibria has long been
well-established in biochemistry, and was primarily constructed to describe
dilute aqueous solutions. Accordingly, few computational approaches have been
developed for making quantitative predictions of binding probabilities in
environments other than dilute isotropic solution. Existing techniques, ranging
from simple automated docking procedures to sophisticated thermodynamics-based
methods, have been developed with soluble proteins in mind. Biologically and
pharmacologically relevant protein-ligand interactions often occur in complex
environments, including lamellar phases like membranes and crowded, non-dilute
solutions. Here we revisit the theoretical bases of ligand binding equilibria,
avoiding overly specific assumptions that are nearly always made when
describing receptor-ligand binding. Building on this formalism, we extend the
asymptotically exact Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation technique to
quantifying occupancies of sites on proteins in a complex bulk, including
phase-separated, anisotropic, or non-dilute solutions, using a
thermodynamically consistent and easily generalized approach that resolves
several ambiguities of current frameworks. To incorporate the complex bulk
without overcomplicating the overall thermodynamic cycle, we simplify the
common approach for ligand restraints by using a single
distance-from-bound-configuration (DBC) ligand restraint during AFEP decoupling
from protein. DBC restraints should be generalizable to binding modes of most
small molecules, even those with strong orientational dependence. We apply this
approach to compute the likelihood that membrane cholesterol binds to known
crystallographic sites on 3 GPCRs at a range of concentrations. Non-ideality of
cholesterol in a binary cholesterol:POPC bilayer is characterized and
consistently incorporated into the interpretation.

expressed in epidemic reproduction ratio number. It is noted that when $R_0 $
exceeds 1, the stochastic model have two different results. But, eventually the
extinction will be reached even though the major epidemic occurs. The question
is how long this process will reach extinction. In this paper, we will focus on
the Markovian process of SIS model when major epidemic occurs. Using the
approximation of quasi--stationary distribution, the expected mean time of
extinction only occurs when the process is one step away from being extinct.
Combining the theorm from Ethier and Kurtz, we use CLT to find the
approximation of this quasi distribution and successfully determine the
asymptotic mean time to extinction of SIS model without demography.

sounds that induce sub-nanometer vibrations of the hair bundle, below the
stochastic noise levels of the surrounding fluid. Hair cells of certain species
are also known to oscillate without external stimulation, indicating the
presence of an underlying active mechanism. We previously demonstrated that
these spontaneous oscillations exhibit chaotic dynamics. By varying the Calcium
concentration and the viscosity of the Endolymph solution, we are able to
modulate the degree of chaos in the hair cell dynamics. We find that the hair
cell is most sensitive to a stimulus of small amplitude when it is poised in
the weakly chaotic regime. Further, we show that the response time to a force
step decreases with increasing levels of chaos. These results agree well with
our numerical simulations of a chaotic Hopf oscillator and suggest that chaos
may be responsible for the extreme sensitivity and temporal resolution of hair
cells.

1490,Distance-based Protein Folding Powered by Deep Learning,"  Contact-assisted protein folding has made very good progress, but two
challenges remain. One is accurate contact prediction for proteins lack of many
sequence homologs and the other is that time-consuming folding simulation is
often needed to predict good 3D models from predicted contacts. We show that
protein distance matrix can be predicted well by deep learning and then
directly used to construct 3D models without folding simulation at all. Using
distance geometry to construct 3D models from our predicted distance matrices,
we successfully folded 21 of the 37 CASP12 hard targets with a median family
size of 58 effective sequence homologs within 4 hours on a Linux computer of 20
CPUs. In contrast, contacts predicted by direct coupling analysis (DCA) cannot
fold any of them in the absence of folding simulation and the best CASP12 group
folded 11 of them by integrating predicted contacts into complex,
fragment-based folding simulation. The rigorous experimental validation on 15
CASP13 targets show that among the 3 hardest targets of new fold our
distance-based folding servers successfully folded 2 large ones with <150
sequence homologs while the other servers failed on all three, and that our ab
initio folding server also predicted the best, high-quality 3D model for a
large homology modeling target. Further experimental validation in CAMEO shows
that our ab initio folding server predicted correct fold for a membrane protein
of new fold with 200 residues and 229 sequence homologs while all the other
servers failed. These results imply that deep learning offers an efficient and
accurate solution for ab initio folding on a personal computer.

1491,Kinetic Theory for Finance Brownian Motion from Microscopic Dynamics,"  Recent technological development has enabled researchers to study social
phenomena scientifically in detail and financial markets has particularly
attracted physicists since the Brownian motion has played the key role as in
physics. In our previous report (arXiv:1703.06739; to appear in Phys. Rev.
Lett.), we have presented a microscopic model of trend-following high-frequency
traders (HFTs) and its theoretical relation to the dynamics of financial
Brownian motion, directly supported by a data analysis of tracking trajectories
of individual HFTs in a financial market. Here we show the mathematical
foundation for the HFT model paralleling to the traditional kinetic theory in
statistical physics. We first derive the time-evolution equation for the
phase-space distribution for the HFT model exactly, which corresponds to the
Liouville equation in conventional analytical mechanics. By a systematic
reduction of the Liouville equation for the HFT model, the
Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchal equations are derived for
financial Brownian motion. We then derive the Boltzmann-like and Langevin-like
equations for the order-book and the price dynamics by making the assumption of
molecular chaos. The qualitative behavior of the model is asymptotically
studied by solving the Boltzmann-like and Langevin-like equations for the large
number of HFTs, which is numerically validated through the Monte-Carlo
simulation. Our kinetic description highlights the parallel mathematical
structure between the financial Brownian motion and the physical Brownian
motion.

1492,Modelling of Dictyostelium Discoideum Movement in Linear Gradient of Chemoattractant,"  Chemotaxis is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon in which cells detect a
spatial gradient of chemoattractant, and then move towards the source. Here we
present a position-dependent advection-diffusion model that quantitatively
describes the statistical features of the chemotactic motion of the social
amoeba {\it Dictyostelium discoideum} in a linear gradient of cAMP (cyclic
adenosine monophosphate). We fit the model to experimental trajectories that
are recorded in a microfluidic setup with stationary cAMP gradients and extract
the diffusion and drift coefficients in the gradient direction. Our analysis
shows that for the majority of gradients, both coefficients decrease in time
and become negative as the cells crawl up the gradient. The extracted model
parameters also show that besides the expected drift in the direction of
chemoattractant gradient, we observe a nonlinear dependency of the
corresponding variance in time, which can be explained by the model.
Furthermore, the results of the model show that the non-linear term in the mean
squared displacement of the cell trajectories can dominate the linear term on
large time scales.

1493,Interplay of spatial dynamics and local adaptation shapes species lifetime distributions and species-area relationships,"  The distributions of species lifetimes and species in space are related,
since species with good local survival chances have more time to colonize new
habitats and species inhabiting large areas have higher chances to survive
local disturbances. Yet, both distributions have been discussed in mostly
separate communities. Here, we study both patterns simultaneously using a
spatially explicit, evolutionary community assembly approach. We present and
investigate a metacommunity model, consisting of a grid of patches, where each
patch contains a local food web. Species survival depends on predation and
competition interactions, which in turn depend on species body masses as the
key traits. The system evolves due to the migration of species to neighboring
patches, the addition of new species as modifications of existing species, and
local extinction events. The structure of each local food web thus emerges in a
self-organized manner as the highly non-trivial outcome of the relative time
scales of these processes. Our model generates a large variety of complex,
multi-trophic networks and therefore serves as a powerful tool to investigate
ecosystems on long temporal and large spatial scales. We find that the observed
lifetime distributions and species-area relations resemble power laws over
appropriately chosen parameter ranges and thus agree qualitatively with
empirical findings. Moreover, we observe strong finite-size effects, and a
dependence of the relationships on the trophic level of the species. By
comparing our results to simple neutral models found in the literature, we
identify the features that are responsible for the values of the exponents.

1494,Trading Strategies Generated by Path-dependent Functionals of Market Weights,"  Almost twenty years ago, E.R. Fernholz introduced portfolio generating
functions which can be used to construct a variety of portfolios, solely in the
terms of the individual companies' market weights. I. Karatzas and J. Ruf
recently developed another methodology for the functional construction of
portfolios, which leads to very simple conditions for strong relative arbitrage
with respect to the market. In this paper, both of these notions of functional
portfolio generation are generalized in a pathwise, probability-free setting;
portfolio generating functions are substituted by path-dependent functionals,
which involve the current market weights, as well as additional
bounded-variation functions of past and present market weights. This
generalization leads to a wider class of functionally-generated portfolios than
was heretofore possible, and yields improved conditions for outperforming the
market portfolio over suitable time-horizons.

1495,On the quasi-sure superhedging duality with frictions,"  We prove the superhedging duality for a discrete-time financial market with
proportional transaction costs under portfolio constraints and model
uncertainty. Frictions are modeled through solvency cones as in the original
model of [Kabanov, Y., Hedging and liquidation under transaction costs in
currency markets. Fin. Stoch., 3(2):237-248, 1999] adapted to the quasi-sure
setup of [Bouchard, B. and Nutz, M., Arbitrage and duality in nondominated
discrete-time models. Ann. Appl. Probab., 25(2):823-859, 2015]. Our results
hold under the condition of No Strict Arbitrage and under the efficient
friction hypothesis.

1496,Reducing Estimation Risk in Mean-Variance Portfolios with Machine Learning,"  In portfolio analysis, the traditional approach of replacing population
moments with sample counterparts may lead to suboptimal portfolio choices. I
show that optimal portfolio weights can be estimated using a machine learning
(ML) framework, where the outcome to be predicted is a constant and the vector
of explanatory variables is the asset returns. It follows that ML specifically
targets estimation risk when estimating portfolio weights, and that
""off-the-shelf"" ML algorithms can be used to estimate the optimal portfolio in
the presence of parameter uncertainty. The framework nests the traditional
approach and recently proposed shrinkage approaches as special cases. By
relying on results from the ML literature, I derive new insights for existing
approaches and propose new estimation methods. Based on simulation studies and
several datasets, I find that ML significantly reduces estimation risk compared
to both the traditional approach and the equal weight strategy.

1497,"Supporting Crowd-Powered Science in Economics: FRACTI, a Conceptual Framework for Large-Scale Collaboration and Transparent Investigation in Financial Markets","  Modern investigation in economics and in other sciences requires the ability
to store, share, and replicate results and methods of experiments that are
often multidisciplinary and yield a massive amount of data. Given the
increasing complexity and growing interaction across diverse bodies of
knowledge it is becoming imperative to define a platform to properly support
collaborative research and track origin, accuracy and use of data. This paper
starts by defining a set of methods leveraging scientific principles and
advocating the importance of those methods in multidisciplinary, computer
intensive fields like computational finance. The next part of this paper
defines a class of systems called scientific support systems, vis-a-vis usages
in other research fields such as bioinformatics, physics and engineering. We
outline a basic set of fundamental concepts, and list our goals and motivation
for leveraging such systems to enable large-scale investigation, ""crowd powered
science"", in economics. The core of this paper provides an outline of FRACTI in
five steps. First we present definitions related to scientific support systems
intrinsic to finance and describe common characteristics of financial use
cases. The second step concentrates on what can be exchanged through the
definition of shareable entities called contributions. The third step is the
description of a classification system for building blocks of the conceptual
framework, called facets. The fourth step introduces the meta-model that will
enable provenance tracking and representation of data fragments and simulation.
Finally we describe intended cases of use to highlight main strengths of
FRACTI: application of the scientific method for investigation in computational
finance, large-scale collaboration and simulation.

1498,Discrete Time Dynamic Programming with Recursive Preferences: Optimality and Applications,"  This paper provides an alternative approach to the theory of dynamic
programming, designed to accommodate the kinds of recursive preference
specifications that have become popular in economic and financial analysis,
while still supporting traditional additively separable rewards. The approach
exploits the theory of monotone convex operators, which turns out to be well
suited to dynamic maximization. The intuition is that convexity is preserved
under maximization, so convexity properties found in preferences extend
naturally to the Bellman operator.

1499,Retirement spending and biological age,"  We solve a lifecycle model in which the consumer's chronological age does not
move in lockstep with calendar time. Instead, biological age increases at a
stochastic non-linear rate in time like a broken clock that might occasionally
move backwards. In other words, biological age could actually decline. Our
paper is inspired by the growing body of medical literature that has identified
biomarkers which indicate how people age at different rates. This offers better
estimates of expected remaining lifetime and future mortality rates. It isn't
farfetched to argue that in the not-too-distant future personal age will be
more closely associated with biological vs. calendar age. Thus, after
introducing our stochastic mortality model we derive optimal consumption rates
in a classic Yaari (1965) framework adjusted to our proper clock time. In
addition to the normative implications of having access to biological age, our
positive objective is to partially explain the cross-sectional heterogeneity in
retirement spending rates at any given chronological age. In sum, we argue that
neither biological nor chronological age alone is a sufficient statistic for
making economic decisions. Rather, both ages are required to behave rationally.
